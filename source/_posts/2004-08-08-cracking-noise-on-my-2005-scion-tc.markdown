I love my Scion tC, don't get me wrong. However, every time I go over a fairly large bump or dip in the road, my sunroof makes this awful cracking noise. It's non-damaging, but it was certainly unsettling for the first month.

  Anyway, I spoke with a guy from Scion Corporate the other day who wanted to poll me on my feelings about my purchase. He told me that he'd heard a significant number of people complain about this problem, and that it was possible they'd actually do a mini-recall to solve this problem. If you have been experiencing this, I'd highly suggest complaining to them about it. I'd love to get this fixed!
