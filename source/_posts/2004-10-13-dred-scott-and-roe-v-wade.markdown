I was as confused as everyone else during the last debate about what the hell Dubya meant when he started talking about Dred Scott. "Huh?" I asked myself, "I'm glad to hear he's opposed to slavery..."

  Bush wasn't actually wandering off into some bizarre tangent. <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2108083/">An article on Slate from Timothy Noah</a> points out that it was actually a veiled threat towards Roe v. Wade. As Timothy Noah puts it, "if you happen to believe that abortion should remain legal in the United States, don't even think about giving Bush your vote."
