I went to the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/outdoors/2008531388_nwwhighlight18.html">Winter Solstice Fire Festival</a> at the Seattle Center this afternoon. It was delayed by a few weeks due to ice, snow, rain, floods, and all of the other nigh-on-Biblical tribulations we heathen-esque Seattleites have suffered over the past month. 

The Seattle PI photographer, Frank Phillips, whose photo appeared in the linked article appears to have his very worst submitted photo selected from the bunch, because it was far cooler, and awe-inspiring than that.

I shot 471 photos total, culled it down to 173 at the end of my first pass, and am working on paring it down to a good 20-30, which will go on Flickr in the next few hours. I'll post  a Part 2 when I'm done. The shots are well worth checking out. <a href="http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/">As Joe McNally would say</a>, more tk.
