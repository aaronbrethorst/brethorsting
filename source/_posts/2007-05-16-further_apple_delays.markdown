<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/16/iphone-delayed-until-october-leopard-delayed-again-until-januar/">Engadet claims</a> that the iPhone's release is being pushed to October, and Leopard's release has commensurately been delayed to January 2008. It's not clear yet if this is true (i.e. Apple hasn't officially come out and said it), but this is a very bad thing if it is true.

  <em>Update</em>: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/05/16/dont-believe-everything-you-hear-iphone-and-leopard-not-delayed">Ars Technica claims</a> this was a hoax perpetrated inside Apple.
