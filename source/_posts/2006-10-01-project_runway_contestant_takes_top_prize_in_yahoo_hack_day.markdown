'Dirty' Diana Eng, <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Project_Runway_2/Bios/Designers/Diana">a contestant from Season 2 of Project Runway</a>, and two other women, Emily Albinski and Audrey Roy, neither of whom I have a crush on, took the top prize at Yahoo's Hack Day '06 with their <em>Blogging in Motion</em> project, which combined the Flickr APIs, a purse, a pedometer and a camera to take pictures every few steps as a person walks along.

  This project actually sounds very similar to one of Diana's previous projects, cited in her Project Runway entrance interview, where a person would wear a hoodie equipped with a heart rate monitor and a camera to take pictures when the wearer's heart rate spiked (i.e. for interesting events).

  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/01/all-women-team-takes-yahoo-hack-day-top-prize/">TechCrunch has more coverage</a>, although it's pretty clear from reading it that Michael Arrington doesn't watch Project Runway.

  <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~populartransit/poptrans/newframeset.htm">Diana's weblog has more information about her</a>, as well, although it hasn't been updated since July.

  <em>Update: I just found out from Wikipedia that Emily Albinski collaborates with Diana on their label <a href="http://www.blackboxnation.com/">Black Box Nation</a>.</em>
