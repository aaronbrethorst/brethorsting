Nintendo is running a truly bizarre contest right now. If you sign up for a nintendo.com account and then go to <a href="http://www.touchingisgood.com/">http://www.touchingisgood.com/</a> you can order a severed mannequin hand. What, you may ask, is a severed mannequin hand good for...outside of giving you the occasional nightmare? Well, if you record a video of your mannequin hand out in the world and submit it to Nintendo you could end up winning a DS or cash. Right.

  I just ordered my mannequin hand. It's going to go in my office right next to my Eric Rudder bobblehead.
