Have you ever spent time browsing <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/index">Edward Tufte's website</a>? You really should. I haven't in quite a while, and I was surprised by how much I had missed previously. The man is absolutely spectacular at the art of presenting information usefully, and also provides other great examples. Two of my personal favorites are on <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000SI&topic_id=1&topic=Ask%20E%2eT%2e">NCAA player graduation rates and UN resolutions</a>.

  Also, I should be back to my regular schedule of posting next week. Things have become a bit hectic.
