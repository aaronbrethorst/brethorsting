Justin CJ asked me to post my travel schedule on my blog so he could keep track of it :)

  I am heading back to Minneapolis this coming Wednesday, April 13 until Sunday.

  Next up, I'll be in Orlando from June 5 - 10 for Tech Ed 2005.

  After that, I'll be back in Minneapolis end of August for my 5 year high school reunion (yes, I am that young ;-) ).

  Schedule unknown after that, although it's safe to assume that I'll be in Minnesota for Christmas and possibly New Year's.
