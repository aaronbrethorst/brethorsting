Helen and I went to the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/events/seattle-georgetown-art-and-garden-walk">13th Annual Art and Garden Walk</a> this afternoon down in the <a href="http://www.georgetownneighborhood.com/">Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle</a>. We had a blast, especially since Helen picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I1ZWRC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sixdollarchim-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000I1ZWRC">Canon Rebel XTi</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sixdollarchim-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000I1ZWRC" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> earlier this week. 

She's adapting pretty well to the camera, and I'm surprising myself with the useful, practical information I've been able to give her about using it. I guess I've learned more over the past year than I thought I had!

Anyway, on to the pix. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157606150562216/">They're all up on Flickr</a> (as always), and here's a subset of my favorites from the day:
