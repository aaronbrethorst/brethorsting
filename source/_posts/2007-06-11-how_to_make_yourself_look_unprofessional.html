I was just reading a truly bizarre (yet oddly heartwarming) story on MSNBC about how <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19179566/">a deaf mother dolphin and her newborn calf are getting along at a marine mammal rehabilitation center in the Florida Keys</a>, but I was terribly disheartened to discover the lack of proofing present in a few paragraphs:
  <blockquote>
  <p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Officials hope the calf will develop communications' skills by speaking to dolphins at Dolphins Plus when the system is fully turned on soon.</p>

  <p class="textBodyBlack"><strong>Mother, calif will not be released
  </strong>Mother and calf are to remain at the Conservancy for at least six months before relocating to a more permanent facility. Castaway can't be released because a dolphin needs to hear to utilize echo localization, or dolphin sonar, to survive.</blockquote>
  <p class="textBodyBlack">Oh. My. God. This is an AP newswire story, too, which has traditionally meant (to me at least) that it would meet certain standards of quality. Evidently not. I think the author(s) would be well-served to spend some time reading <a href="http://www.badlanguage.net/">Matthew Stibbe's blog</a>.</p>
