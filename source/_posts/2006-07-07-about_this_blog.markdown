I'm Aaron Brethorst, a Program Manager, software developer, HCI junkie, and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">a wicked Astropop player</a>. Currently, I work for Microsoft as the User Experience Program Manager for the Developer Division, creators of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio">Visual Studio</a>, the .NET Framework, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/default.mspx">Microsoft Expression product suite</a>, and a number of other interesting products.

  I also develop shareware for the Mac at present (and Windows in the future). Currently, the only product I have available on the market is <a href="http://www.chimpsoftware.com">iRooster</a>, the alarm clock for Mac OS X.

  I find myself digging up information about visual and interaction design, User Experience, and other topics quite often, and wanted to share the most-interesting bits in a manner that is somewhat more expressive than <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, hence this blog.

  My opinions are, as always, my own. My employer bears no responsibility for anything published here, etc. etc.
