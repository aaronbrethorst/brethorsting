There's been lots of chatter in print and on blogs over the past week about iRooster.

  <a href="http://theradblog.typepad.com/theradblog/2005/03/irooster_mornin.html">Jonathan on the RAD blog likes iRooster</a>.
  <a href="http://ambermac.blogspot.com/2005/03/iwake-to-irooster-morning-mac-download.html">So does Amber from TechTV</a>.
  <a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/mt/archives/2005_03.html#002459">Joe likes my new icon for iRooster</a>.
  <a href="http://brianpand.blogspot.com/2005/03/more-reasons-to-get-ipod.html">Brian digs iRooster too</a>, and reminds me that I need to create some "Year of the iRooster" marketing material.
  <a href="http://www.theappleblog.com/2005/03/10/irooster-turn-your-mac-into-a-2000-alarm-clock/">Josh from the Apple Blog loved iRooster</a>.
  <a href="http://www.macslack.com/list/software/#91">Macslack says it's slick and flexible</a>.

  Oh yeah, and there was a nice little shout-out for iRooster in <a href="http://www.machome.com/">MacHome Magazine</a>'s Q and A section this month. I'm going to get that one framed ;-).

  <em>Nice</em>.
