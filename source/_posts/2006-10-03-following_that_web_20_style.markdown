I just found <a href="http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/current-style.cfm">a reasonably interesting article on designing for that "Web 2.0 look and feel"</a>. The author sums up the basics of ca. 2006 web design as:
  <blockquote>
      *  Simple layout
      * Centered orientation
      * 3D effects, used sparingly
      * Soft, neutral background colours
      * Strong colour, used sparingly
      * Cute icons, used sparingly
      * Plenty of whitespace
      * Nice big text
  </blockquote>

  yup.
