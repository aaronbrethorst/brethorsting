I'm banging out a little application on Mac OS X in Obj-C/Cocoa currently. With any luck, I will have this done in the near future, and I'll sell a few copies per month. I tend not to have to use the documentation for NSImage that often; iRooster doesn't do too much with these objects. The app I'm working on right now does have to a little bit. In any case, I just had a serious what-the-fuck moment with the Cocoa docs.

  <i>The preferred way to name an image is to ask for a name without the extension, but to include the extension for a filename.</i>

  huh? You're welcome to share in my experience by checking out the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/ObjC_classic/Classes/NSImage.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000344/imageNamed_">documentation for NSImage</a> on Apple's website.
