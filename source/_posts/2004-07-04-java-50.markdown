In honor of Sun's decision to rename <a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-06/sunflash.20040628.3.html">Java 1.5 to Java 5.0</a> I am officially renaming iRooster 1.2 to be iRooster version 20.0. Also, in honor of Apple, this release must be referred to as iRooster XX. I intend to release iRooster XXX within a few months. This release will be restricted to Vin Diesel fans and those over the age of 18 (or 21 in some states).
