I just heard about a fantastic hands-on lab you can download that walks you through <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2007/06/13/wpf-hands-on-lab-build-an-outlook-2007-ui-clone.aspx">building a replica of Outlook 2007's user interface in WPF</a>. It's fantastic to see such detailed, useful examples of building Avalon content finally coming out. Being able to build reflections into your application launcher is all well and good, but I'd rather have a full PIM application that can be extended with these sorts of effects. This also reminds me that I need to bring my signed copy of <a href="http://adamnathan.net/wpf/">WPF Unleashed</a> home with me so that I can start running through it.
