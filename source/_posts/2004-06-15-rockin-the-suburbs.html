I am trying to make things right in the world again. In a fit of despair I emailed Ben Folds' brother, Chuck Folds. "Dear Chuck," I write, "I am a freaky psychopath trying to right a great karmic imbalance after mystery musician bought my software. Please let me give you and your brother iRooster."

  Well, scratch the freaky psychopath part, but I feel that's how I came off. How would you like it if some random guy emailed you and started blathering about this kind of crap?

  Anyway, I'm just rockin' the suburbs. Just like ::ahem:: Ben Folds does. ;-) (do you have any clue who bought iRooster yet?)
