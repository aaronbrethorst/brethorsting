I'll be the first to admit it: I don't know the first thing about drawing, and it never ceases to irritate me. For this reason, I was incredibly excited when I ran into <a href="http://www.drawspace.com/">Drawspace</a> by way of <a href="http://www.jacksonfish.com/">Hillel Cooperman's weblog</a>, today.

  They cover everything from positive and negative spaces to <a href="http://www.drawspace.com/lessons/lesson.php?id=z01">a case study on how Leonardo da Vinci drew noses</a>.
