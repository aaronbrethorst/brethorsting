Apple recently published an article on making Cocoa apps AppleScriptable. It's fairly bare-bones, but it's more information than I had before, so I'm not going to gripe too much. You can find it over at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/applescriptforapps.html">Apple's Developer website</a>.
