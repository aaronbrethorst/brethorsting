<a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/11/14/terrorism/index.html">Glenn Greenwald on our favorite chickenhawk tough guys' reactions to the KSM trial</a>:

<blockquote>[T]he Right's reaction to yesterday's announcement -- we're too afraid to allow trials and due process in our country -- is the textbook definition of "surrendering to terrorists."  It's the same fear they've been spewing for years.  As always, the Right's tough-guy leaders wallow in a combination of pitiful fear and cynical manipulation of the fear of their followers.  Indeed, it's hard to find any group of people on the globe who exude this sort of weakness and fear more than the American Right.</blockquote>
