I wanted to share a fantastic blog posting on accessibility that I just found by way of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000690.html">Coding Horror</a>. As part of Michael Hunter's DDJ blogging series entitled "YOU ARE NOT DONE YET," <a href="http://www.ddj.com/blog/debugblog/archives/2006/07/you_are_not_don_7.html">Michael posted a great list of accessibility scenarios that should be checked for every application</a>. One example includes:
  <blockquote>Run in high contrast mode, where rather than a full color palette you have only a very few colors. Is your application still functional? Are all status flags and other UI widgets visible? Are your toolbars and other UI still legible? Does any part of your UI not honor this mode?</blockquote>
