Joe Clark, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=sixdollarchim-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F073571150X">Building Accessible Websites</a> (which needs a cover less-reminiscent of a certain web meme, in my opinion), wrote <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/tohellwithwcag2">an impassioned tirade against the perceived uselessness of the W3C's WCAG 2 guidelines</a> back in May. Joe makes a lot of sense, and if you are at all involved in developing websites, I think it behooves you to read this article.

  A few relevant quotes:
  <em>"[T]o an uninformed reader, WCAG 2 seems reasonable. It isn’t, and you as a working standards-compliant developer are going to find it next to impossible to implement WCAG 2."</em>

  <em>"The WCAG development process is inaccessible to anyone who doesn’t speak English. More importantly, it’s inaccessible to some people with disabilities."</em>

  <em>"[S]lideshows are now officially deemed to be “video,” which will come as a surprise to Flickr users."</em>
