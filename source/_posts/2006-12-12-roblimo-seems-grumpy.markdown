<blockquote>Imagine working for a company that is tolerated, at best, in many social circles. Imagine being a computer science graduate, going to a class reunion, telling people you work for Microsoft, and watching your former classmates slowly back away as if you'd just told them you had a venereal disease.</blockquote>

  - Robin 'Roblimo' Miller <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/12/12/085222">on his recent Microsoft corporate junket</a>.

  The funny thing about this is that I cannot vouch for Roblimo's assumptions about class reunions and working for the 'Soft. In fact, I had the exact opposite experience. My former classmates thought it was incredibly cool that I was working for Microsoft. You hear about the blog echo chamber all the time; perhaps there's an equivalent for people who are a little too plugged into the Linux community.
