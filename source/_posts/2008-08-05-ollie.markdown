I put up <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157606395430763/">two more pictures from Minneapolis</a> a minute ago. They're both of my sister's family's dog, Ollie, who is a huge bundle of energy wrapped up in a boxer body. He's a sweet dog, but not the smartest thing in the world, unfortunately.
