I just found a heinously strange link through <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/sahilmalik/archive/2004/11/28/33936.aspx  ">Sahil Malik</a>: <a href="http://www.dba-oracle.com/dress_code.htm">http://www.dba-oracle.com/dress_code.htm</a>. This details, in disturbingly exact standards, the dress code for his database consultants.

  Let's walk through a couple examples here:
  <strong>Tie</strong> - Must be conservative, nothing George Bush wouldn't wear.

  <strong>Grooming</strong> - Protruding nasal hair is prohibited.

  No Neanderthal-style single eyebrows are allowed, and you should shave any loose hair on your forehead or the palms of your hands.

  <strong>Perfume</strong> - Too much perfume is considered especially heinous when the stench is so strong as to cause allergic reactions or when the odor can be detected from more than 3 feet away.

  But who are the Oracle consultants passing down these stringent dress code requirements?

  <strong>Don Burleson</strong>

  <strong>Colonel John Garmany</strong>

  I gotta say, though, I only wish I could draw $500/hour fees for my work. Hrm.
