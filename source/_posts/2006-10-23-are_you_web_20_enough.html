So, <a href="http://30secondrule.com/">the guys from 30secondrule.com</a> were apparently sitting around...
  <blockquote>commenting on how so many people are talking Web 2.0 this and Web 2.0 that, and while so doing these people point out one or a dozen sites or features or hacks, yet itâ€™s still near impossible to get a good, clear understanding of what really makes something Web 2.0...It would be nice, we thought, if there was a simple tool, a validator, that could examine a Web site and declare, with complete scientific authority, if it was or was not really Web 2.0.</blockquote>

  So, of course they built their own <a href="http://web2.0validator.com/">Web 2.0-based Web 2.0 validator</a>, which checks for such inaneness as
  <ul>
  <li>Does your site use Prototype</li>
  <li>Does your site refer to Delicious</li>
  <li>Does your site mention "Architecture of Participation"</li>
  <li><em>And so forth...</em> you get the idea, in any case</li>
  </ul>

  The sheer inaneness of this idea is breathtaking, and deeply amusing at the same time. It's good to know someone still has a sense of humor about this whole thing.
