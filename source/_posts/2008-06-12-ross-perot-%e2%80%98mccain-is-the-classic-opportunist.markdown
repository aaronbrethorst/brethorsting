<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1024927/The-wife-John-McCain-callously-left-behind.html">Interesting article from the Daily Mail about John McCain's history</a>, and how he screwed around on his first wife with a variety of women until he finally settled on Cindy Lou Hensley, divorced his first wife, and married Cindy a month later. Great guy with great moral fiber. Clearly. 
<blockquote>Ross Perot...believes that both Carol McCain [McCain's first wife] and the American people have been taken in by a man who is unusually slick and cruel – even by the standards of modern politics.

‘McCain is the classic opportunist. He’s always reaching for attention and glory,’ he said.</blockquote>
