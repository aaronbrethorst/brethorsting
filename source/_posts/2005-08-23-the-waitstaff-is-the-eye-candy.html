I hit Joey's on South Lake Union with my friend Rob last night. I'd heard about it from a Seattle bar-hopping mailing list I subscribe to, and finally had a chance to make it in. We were only around long enough to have one drink, unfortunately, but it's definitely worth a second, third, or fourth visit.
