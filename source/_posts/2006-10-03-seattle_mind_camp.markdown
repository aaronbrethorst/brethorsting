I'll be at <a href="http://www.seattlemind.com/">Seattle Mind Camp</a> this year. Will you?
  <blockquote>What happens when you put 250 of Seattle's smartest geeks in a creative environment for 24 hours? We're not sure either, but we'd like to find out. It's time to meet and connect with those involved in the interesting projects going on in Seattle in a relaxed environment. Come, camp out, create.</blockquote>

  Mind Camp takes place on November 11 and 12 2006. It looks like I know (or know of) a small handful of the people who will be attending. Oddly, there doesn't seem to be a ton of overlap between the people I know who attended the TechCrunch party and this.
