For all of you who missed Sony's lame-ass E3 press conference last week, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJElsNaC6yQ">someone has compressed all of the salient points into a one minute clip on YouTube</a>.

  For those of you unwilling to invest that minute, here are the highlights:
  - Riiiiiidge Racer!
  - $599
  - Riiiiiidge Racer!
  - Take part in authentic Japanese battles, like one featuring a gigantic crab boss.
