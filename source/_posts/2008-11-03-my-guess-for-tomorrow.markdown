Obama 364 to McCain 174. <a href="http://rove.com/uploads/0000/0051/McCain-Obama_11_3_08_FINAL.pdf">Same as Karl Rove</a>Â is predicting, perversely, except that I genuinely think that <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/on-road-atlanta-georgia.html">Georgia is going to flip</a>, given the African-American turnout I've been reading about. Obama wins all of the Kerry states, plus CO, NM, FL, OH, GA and VA. Missouri will lose its bellwether status, although it's going to be a nailbiter that may well end up in a recount (not that it'll matter).

The networks will essentially call the election by 7:30PM PST, after Ohio and Virginia are called for Obama.

In related news, pundits are overwhelmingly predicting that I will stumble into work late on Wednesday, nursing a bad hangover.
