I just read <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/07/24/zillow-and-housing-prices/">a blog post from Robert Scoble about Zillow</a>, the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/245815_zillow25.html">super-hot</a> real estate start-up based here in Seattle. Robert discusses Zillow underpricing his Bothell, WA house's value by $30,000, and why it's best to buy a house in Half Moon Bay during the summer. Anyway, that's really beside the point, here.

  I haven't checked out <a href="http://www.zillow.com/">Zillow's website</a> since April of this year; the last time I saw it, I was impressed by the sense of fun they were trying to convey through their website and their brand, and I thought they succeeded admirably.

  Too many technology companies are obsessed with themselves or their technology, and fall into a "we're a professional, serious company with serious goals, and levity is bad" trap. Although too much of it can negate your credibility, having a sense of humor and an understanding that this stuff (i.e. technology) should be fun can take you a long way (grain of salt: the opinions expressed here are from a person who sells software through a company called <a href="http://www.chimpsoftware.com">Chimp Software</a>).

  Zillow conveys a great sense of fun (or at least humanity) in several ways: such as <a href="http://www.zillowblog.com/zillow_blog/2006/02/were_live_wwwzi.html">their blog</a>, which is written entirely from the perspective of the company's employees, <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/FamousBirdsEye.htm">their compendium of famous houses</a>, and even an amusing little side-comment <a href="http://www.zillow.com/learn/buyer/start/FinancingOverview.htm">about financing a house:</a>

  <blockquote>To help navigate [home buying's] complexities, we created a financing section where we start with the basics and will dig deeper into the world of interest rates, ARMs, <em>and a Jedi-sounding thing called HELOCs (pronounced "HE-locks")</em>.</blockquote>
