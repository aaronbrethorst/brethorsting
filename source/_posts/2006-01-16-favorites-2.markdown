And lest I forget, my abbreviated 2005 favorites:

  Album: Takk, by Sigur Ros, followed very, very closely by Plans for Death Cab for Cutie
  Asian Person: Helen
  Asian Person that I am Not Coerced into Listing: Helen, still
  Beach: Waikiki in Honolulu
  Movie: Batman Begins (but you have to keep in mind that I, essentially, saw no movies after July 2005)
  Star Wars Movie: Empire Strikes Back (still)
  Star Wars Prequel Movie: Revenge of the Sith, duh
