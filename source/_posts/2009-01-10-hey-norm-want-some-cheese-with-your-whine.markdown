Somebody should stop by <a href="http://www.surdyks.com/">Surdyk's</a> and pick up a nice gouda or brie for Norm. <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/01/obama_my_plan_will_save_or_create_3-4_million_jobs.php">From TPM</a>:
<blockquote>Norm Coleman is complaining that the Senate's decision to close his offices after his term expired -- leaving the seat vacant while Coleman challenges the election results in court -- is hurting Minnesotans who have been relying on him for constituent services. "There are people -- this is real-life stuff -- who come to us for help," Coleman. "They're being hurt by Harry Reid." Meanwhile, Reid's office denies that they promised Coleman they would let his staffers keep working, though they are working to come to an acceptable solution.</blockquote>
Hey Norm, I know the perfect way to resolve this situation! Withdraw your spurious lawsuit, dumbass!
