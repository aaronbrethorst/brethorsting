I never would have imagined such ludicrousness, even out of these people.

First, from <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/08/tea-party-sign-keep-the-guvmint-out-of-my-medicare.php">Talking Points Memo</a>:

<blockquote>"'Keep the guvmint (sic) out of my medicare,'" our friendly narrator observes. "Not so sure about that one."

It seems that this sentiment from the right is not an urban legend, after all. Either that, or some really clever left-wing plants have infiltrated into the crowds.</blockquote>

Second, from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_08/019423.php">Washington Monthly</a>: A conservative activist in St. Louis was apparently "brutally attacked" at a town hall last week. He's now seeking donations to pay for his medical care due to his lack of health insurance.

<blockquote>Wait, the conservative opponent of health care reform, fighting (literally) to defeat a plan that would bring coverage to those who lose their jobs, lost his coverage because he got laid off?

I'm not in a position to say whether Gladney sustained genuine injuries or whether he's exaggerating for 15 minutes of Fox News fame and a lucrative out-of-court settlement.

Either way, the new right-wing cause celebre needs to take up a collection to pay for his medical bills because he doesn't have health insurance. It's a fascinating sign of the times.</blockquote>

Last, <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/08/dont_need_to_be_a_rocket_scientist.php">also from TPM</a>: 

<blockquote>[In] the latest Investors Business Daily editorial about how the 'death panel' will condemn all handicapped or disabled people to death on some horrid wind-swept mountain, it notes that ... "People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless."

Needless to say, Hawking, who is recognized as one of the great theoretical physicists of the 20th and 21st century, was born in the UK and has lived his entire life there.</blockquote>

Just, <em>wow</em>.
