I've been thinking a lot about <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=8&q=http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-004Computation-StructuresFall2002/A50A07EF-5721-4A61-B90E-5EB1C86344B8/0/lecture18sp01.pdf&e=912">infinite streams</a> lately. I haven't spent any time whatsoever on this concept since I was a freshman in college taking Structure of Computer Programs 1, aka Scheme 101, aka the badass Comp Sci weeder course from hell.

  Computer Science 1901, Structure of Computer Programs 1, was hardcore. There's no better way to describe it. 200 freshmen came in thinking they were the shit; maybe 100 -- tops -- came out a little more humbled. It took me six weeks of the semester before I really grokked Scheme. I'd programmed in C for a quarter, but nothing can really prepare you for functional programming.

  As Edward Norton once put it, at first "your ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, you were carved out of wood."
