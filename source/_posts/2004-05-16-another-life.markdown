I just had the weirdest feeling. I saw a picture on <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/sterling/index.blog?entry_id=314229">Bruce Sterling's weblog</a> that looked eerily familiar to me. It took me a few minutes to figure out what it was, where I had seen it, when that was, and who I was with.

  I am nowhere near where I thought things would go when I was last in front of that statue. It's been only about seven months, but it feels like virtually everything in life changed for me between now and then.

  I haven't talked to the person I saw that with since early January, and I don't really expect to talk with her ever again. It's a pity that I don't care that I'll never talk with her again.

  Life life life. Life has the strangest way of doing unexpected things to you.

  Honeywell, Lori, Marta, Amy, Minneapolis, the Purple Onion.

  Microsoft, Jamie, Seattle, El Diablo.

  Sorry if this all seems oblique. I don't feel like it's appropriate for me to get into the gory details, but I still want a record of all of this for myself.
