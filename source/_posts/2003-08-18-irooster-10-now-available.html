iRooster, a Mac OS X-only application, allows you to quickly and easily create alarms to wake you up in the morning. Create a special playlist in iTunes for waking up, or use any of the pre-existing iTunes playlists: iRooster will play back your Library, smart playlists, and normal playlists too.

It's finally available for downloading. <a href="http://www.sixdollarchimp.com">Go get a copy</a>.
