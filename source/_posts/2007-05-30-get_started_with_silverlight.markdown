I just found a ton of great content on <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/learnvideos.aspx">learning how to develop for Silverlight</a> on the SL website. It includes the full contents of every Mix'07 session that centered on Silverlight along with a bunch of great how-to screencasts, including one from one of my favorite design firms, <a href="http://www.metaliq.com/">Metaliq</a>, on <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/learnvideo.aspx?video=125">their awesome video editing app Top Banana</a>.
