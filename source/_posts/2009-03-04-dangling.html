A metal-smithing friend asked me to refresh the photographs of her jewelry for her.

I did some test shooting with Helen's earrings to familiarize myself with some of the concepts. I wasn't as happy with the background as I would like.

Unfortunately, I was under a tight time deadline, so I didn't have enough time to set up a separate strobe to smooth out the background. Oh well, next time. 

Strobist: Softbox w/ 580EX II @ 1/4 on camera right.
