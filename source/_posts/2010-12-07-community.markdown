<em>Prompt: Community. Where have you discovered community, online or otherwise, in 2010? What community would you like to join, create or more deeply connect with in 2011?</em>

That's an easy one: <a href="http://officenomads.com/">Office Nomads</a>! I decided to check out Capitol Hill's coworking space in September after running into their cofounder, Jacob, at a bar where I chatted with him for an hour about the experience of working in such a space instead of a cafe. I showed up the next day and plunked down my credit card after only a couple hours of blissful, productive work.

I had spent the past twelve months working in cafes, primarily 15th Ave Coffee and Tea, and was tired of the environment, the noise, the uncomfortable seating arrangements, the less than ideal wifi, and everything else about it. I was overdue for a change, and I'm relieved I made it, because being in the company of like-minded, diligently-working people for 6-8 hours a day has made me significantly happier and more productive than I was just three months ago.

In 2011? I'd love to become further plugged in to Seattle's startup community. I've gotten a lot of exposure to it over the past year, but there is always plenty of room to grow.
