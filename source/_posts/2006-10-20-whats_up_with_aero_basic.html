An article on shell revealed goes into a great deal of depth about <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/10/12/Frequently-asked-questions-about-the-Aero-Basic-window-frame.aspx">why the Windows Vista Aero Basic theme looks the way it does</a>.

  <blockquote>
  <strong>Why does Aero have a solid 1-pixel black border inside the frame, and Aero Basic doesn't?</strong>
  Because the DWM is rendering this black border, and the DWM is absent in Aero Basic. The glass starts in the non-client area and stops after the client glass margin, and there's intentionally no seam between the client and non-client glass areas.
  This client/non-client blend illusion is kept in Aero Basic for windows without caption text, like Explorer and the Aero Wizards.</blockquote>

  Sure, it's not really that important in the grand scheme of things, but it's hella interesting from the 'low-level, nitpicky perspective.'
