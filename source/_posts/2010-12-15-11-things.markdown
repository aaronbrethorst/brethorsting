<em>What are 11 things your life doesn’t need in 2011? How will you go about eliminating them? How will getting rid of these 11 things change your life?</em>
<ol>
	<li>Unnecessary stress</li>
	<li>Unhelpful people</li>
	<li>Overextending myself</li>
	<li>Forgetting to eat or drink enough water</li>
	<li>A lack of travel</li>
	<li>Unnecessary expenses</li>
	<li>Not getting enough exercise</li>
</ol>
There, that's seven. How will I eliminate them? I doubt I'll be able to eliminate all of them, but I can at least be cognizant and do my best to change my behavior of one or two at a time until I internalize them.
