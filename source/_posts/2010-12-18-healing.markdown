<em>What healed you this year? Was it sudden, or a drip-by-drip evolution? How would you like to be healed in 2011?</em>

Antibiotics didn't, that's for sure. I had a minor eye infection a few months back that, thankfully, went away of its own volition. Not having real health care this year has actually been rather worrisome. I bought coverage at QLiance after this incident and intend to be healed by nothing other than gut-rocking full-spectrum antibiotics in 2011.
