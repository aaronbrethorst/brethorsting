I was out shooting pictures at the <a href="http://www.seattletilth.org/events/Harvest%20Fair/HarvestFair">Seattle Tilth Harvest Fair</a> this afternoon (lots of fun, and pix will be up tonight or tomorrow) when I checked the AppStore to see how Election '08 was doing, only to discover that I had broken into the top 10! Sweet! :)
