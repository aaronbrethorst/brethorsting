Generally, most people don't associate great design with Microsoft, but the company has been making great strides in this area for the past few years. I just found a link to the official <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/design/">Microsoft Design</a> website through <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/07/26/678606.aspx">Jensen Harris</a> this morning, and wanted to share it.

  Disappointingly, I don't see any screenshots of Visual Studio on display on the website, but <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/design/people_donna.html">one of my favorite people in the whole company</a> does have her own bio page. I've worked very closely with Donna, the Design Manager for Visual Studio, for the past three years, and I've always been incredibly impressed with her passion, drive, and commitment to giving Visual Studio's users the most pleasant, usable, and attractive development tools environment possible. She's a real asset to Microsoft.

  As Donna puts it:
  <blockquote>"It's about an integrated whole and all the products have to work seamlessly together."</blockquote>
