My web browser's home page is set to MSN.com, and I just noticed an interesting-sounding article on the main page, entitled <a href="http://openfordesign.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2tech1_alexrich&GT1=8836">Designing for the Visually Impaired</a>. As I have a fairly keen interest in this topic, I opened the link to discover a beautiful Flash-based website entitled Open for Design, which appears to be curated by Infiniti, whatever that means (when is an ad not an ad, or vice versa, I suppose).

  What struck me immediately, though, is that I'm not entirely confident that this website is actually accessible. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/">It should be entirely possible to make a Flash site accessible</a> (and easy to use), but the sense I get in general is that most sites are anything but. Oh, the irony.

  Will, if you're reading this, could you take a pass over the aforementioned site and let me know what you think about it?
