Looking for the missing Capistrano recipes for Rails and Nginx from <a href="http://jonmagic.com/assets/2007/2/21/jonmagic_recipes.txt">http://jonmagic.com/assets/2007/2/21/jonmagic_recipes.txt</a>? No need to fret: The Internet Wayback Machine actually did what it was supposed to for once, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070623030742/http://jonmagic.com/assets/2007/2/21/jonmagic_recipes.txt">and cached the file</a>.

  Also, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070225130819/jonmagic.com/assets/2007/2/21/nginx.conf">the nginx.conf file can be found there too</a>.
