I bet my friend Neil a pint of beer that Obama would win Georgia. He accepted.

I bet my friend Dominic with 2:1 odds that Obama will lose Arizona. He accepted. It would be worth two pints of beer to me to see McCain so thoroughly defeated, especially if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Shadegg">Shadegg</a> goes down, too.
