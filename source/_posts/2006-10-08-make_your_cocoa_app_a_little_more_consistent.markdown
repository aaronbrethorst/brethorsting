One of my biggest beefs with Apple is the amount of time and energy they expend on the 'you must follow the Apple Ux Guidelines' mantra, followed by releasing applications that look nothing look their own guidelines. What this ends up meaning to <a href="http://www.chimpsoftware.com">your average developer trying to maintain an iLife-esque application</a> is that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">they must spend huge amounts of time building custom controls that look and feel like Apple's</a>.

  Fortunately, <a href="http://www.seanpatrickobrien.com/2006/09/28/ilifecontrols-10/">Sean Patrick O'Brien has released a new framework</a> that aims to take some of the drudge work out of beating back Apple's fire and motion strategy. <a href="http://www.seanpatrickobrien.com/2006/09/24/a-new-blog-for-a-new-mac-developer/">A screenshot is available on his site, as well</a>.

  <blockquote>I hope that by providing developers with a free solution to getting the look and feel of Apple’s iLife suite, I’ll be able to help eliminate some of the inconsistencies between third-party applications’ interfaces, and give developers the opportunity to produce more professional looking products.</blockquote>
