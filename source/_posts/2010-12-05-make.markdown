<a href="http://www.reverb10.com/december-6-make/">December 6 – Make</a>.  What was the last thing you made? What materials did you use? Is there something you want to make, but you need to clear some time for it?

Man, what haven't I made? The last thing of mine that was 'released' was the <a href="http://tippr.com">Tippr</a> app for iPhone. I'm actually building a manual test case management tool in my spare time right now, since I need one and the options on the market all seem to suck. I'm using Ruby on Rails 3.0, hosting on Heroku, backing it with a Postgres database, presenting it with Haml, and crafting it with love.

There are five dozen or so things I'd love to build if only I had more time. Every week seems to add another couple items to the list...
