<blockquote>We've spent the last few months trying to make the business behind JPG sustain itself, and we've reached the end of the line. We all deeply believe in everything JPG represents, but just weren't able to raise the money needed to keep JPG alive in these extraordinary economic times. We sought out buyers, spoke with numerous potential investors, and pitched several last-ditch creative efforts, all without success. As a result, jpgmag.com will shut down on Monday, January 5, 2009.</blockquote>
The funny thing is that I just received a renewal request letter in the mail from them a day or two ago. I doubt I would've seen my money returned to me if I had bothered to send a check in.
