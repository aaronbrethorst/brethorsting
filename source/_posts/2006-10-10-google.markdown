I'm a bit perplexed as to what's going on at Google right now.

  Less than two months ago, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/some-homepage-revisions.html">Marissa blogged</a> about changes to the Google homepage, including the addition of Google Video to the main bar. The rumormill spun up to <a href="http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2006/09/froogle-is-dead-long-live-froogle.html">state very loudly</a> that Froogle was about to get canned, which Google promptly denied with a fantastic non-denial.

  On Friday, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google6oct06,0,945092.story?track=mostviewed-homepage">a big splash was made</a> around not "confusing their users" with new products all the time, and instead building out existing products.

  Yesterday, Google dropped a bomb and $1.6 Billion in stock to buy YouTube, in a decision that leaves me somewhat perplexed, <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2006/10/09/i-still-think-google-is-crazy/">and Mark Cuban nigh on apoplectic</a>.

  Only time will tell as to whether this will turn out to be a Skype or a Bungie. Hmm.

  <em>Update:</em> Sorry about the blog spam. I hate MovableType sometimes.
