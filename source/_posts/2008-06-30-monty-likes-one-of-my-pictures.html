John Montgomery, my old boss from Popfly, gave me some great props on his blog earlier today. God bless the blogger echo chamber: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/johnmont/archive/2008/06/30/art.aspx">blogging about blogs about me</a>. 
<blockquote>One of my friends, and a former teammate, is Aaron Brethorst. For the longest time I thought of him as the amusing guy from VScore who attended shiproom. It was only later that I realized he was an accomplished photographer. The photograph below is of the Smith Tower in Seattle, one of my wife's favorite buildings. </blockquote>
Anyway, thanks again for the positive feedback, John! It's much appreciated :)
