I just found a wonderfully amusing adaptation of <a href="http://www.ee0r.com/lolckyhorror/index.html">Rocky Horror, as if scripted by lolcatz</a>. Naturally, I decided to wrap it up with a Popfly mashup, which you can see <a href="http://www.popfly.ms/users/aaron/LolckyHorror">through this link</a> (<em>toucha toucha toucha touch me!</em>). Creating this Popfly mashup was wonderfully easy, too: I took our ImageScraper component, handed it the URL for the Rocky Horror pictures, and connected (via drag-and-drop) to our Flipbook component. Done and done.
