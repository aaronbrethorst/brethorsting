I ran across this a couple days ago, and have been trying to find time to blog it ever since. It's an interactive 'periodic table' of visualization tools and techniques, chunked into data, information, concept, strategy, metaphor and compound categories. Need to know the difference between an infomural and and a rich picture? It'll show you everything you'll need and much more.
