Every year around this time, I start thinking that I need to do some cleanup on my personal website. It kinda-sorta happens eventually, but it seems to trickle in over the course of December, January, February and March, culminating in April when I'm sick of having three separate designs scattered about my website. Sigh, here we go again. On the plus side of things, I must give props to <a href="http://themeshaper.com/">ThemeShaper</a> for their Wordpress theme 'framework.'
