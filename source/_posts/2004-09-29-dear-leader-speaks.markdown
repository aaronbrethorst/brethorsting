I just found <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm">the best damned website in the entire world</a>. It's the English version of the Korean Central News Agency of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea... aka the official North Korean mouthpiece. Only here can you read the truth about the American Imperialists ::cough:: and the <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2004/200409/news09/30.htm#10">nation-wide physical strength checkup</a>.
