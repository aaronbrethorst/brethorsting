Today should be Tiger Day here at the sixDollarChimp ranch. We're heading out to pick up a copy as soon as we can rouse ourselves from our slumber on this hopefully beautiful Saturday morning. Friday would have been Tiger Day, but <a href="http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/">bigger (babel'ing) fish had to fry first</a>.

  Our intention is to be waiting to acquire one (1) copy of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger (since there is only one of us here at sixDollarChimp, after all) shortly after 9:30 AM this morning when the Apple Store in Seattle's University Village shopping mall opens.

  We'll back everything up, get Tiger installed, and hopefully rock through whatever bugs may present themselves by end of day Saturday, and get an update out there to address whatever issues may arise from this update. God speed, young man, etc. etc.
