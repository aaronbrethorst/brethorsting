<a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/12/a_few_predictions_for_the_new_year.html">I made eight predictions at the end of last year</a>. With 2007 now about 18% finished, how am I doing?
  <ol>
  	<li>Apple has not released Leopard yet. We'll see what happens. I have a sneaking suspicion that its UI will actually end up looking very much like the iPhone demo we saw in January, which means I'll be wrong.</li>
  	<li>The word "innovative" has not been used with another Microsoft product, yet, but I have high hopes for this one :)</li>
  	<li>I have yet to start offering more thoughts on Web 2.0-ish stuff, but this will certainly start happening soon. I still have a lot of thoughts on UAC to churn through.</li>
  	<li>CORRECT! Slashdot has already fallen below 300 (at 325 right now), <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=slashdot.org">according to Alexa</a>.</li>
  	<li>Podtech.net has yet to change its name, but I still hold out some hope that I will be correct.</li>
  	<li>Kinda sorta right. There's only IMAP push, and no Exchange synchronization.</li>
  	<li>DB has yet to post anything to his blog :P</li>
  	<li>We have yet to see MGS 4 or a Final Fantasy title announced for Xbox 360, but I still have hopes. On a related note, though, Dragon Warrior 9 will be a Nintendo DS exclusive.</li>
  </ol>
