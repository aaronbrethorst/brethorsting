<a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">I saw one of the newest Apple ads last night</a>, which featured the PC trying to figure out which version of Windows Vista he should install. I'll admit: it was as funny as all the others, which is to say that I and the two other Microsofties I was with (a senior developer and a test lead) got a huge kick out of it. That said, the ad still annoys me on some level.

  Apple's fundamental argument is that you have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/choose.mspx">too many options</a> when you try to choose which version of Windows Vista to get with your PC. Of course, this argument ignores the fact that <em>you won't actually have six versions from which to choose</em>. Let's evaluate each of the Windows SKUs in turn:
  <ul>
  	<li>Starter - This isn't available in the United States, nor is it available in English. It's cheap. Really cheap. If you're reading this blog, I doubt you're in the target market for Starter.</li>
  	<li>Home Basic - Umm, it's Vista. It's also pretty cheap. It also doesn't do Glass. I doubt you'll ever see this unless you try buying a super-low end computer. And, honestly, if you're only going to spend <em>half the price of the cheapest Mac</em> on a new computer, you're probably not that interested in Media Center.</li>
  	<li>Home Premium - It's Vista, and it's pretty awesome. To paraphrase what the PC might say in this case: 'Hi, I'm a PC. And a TV. And a Tivo. And a Tablet PC.'</li>
  	<li>Business - It's Vista, and it's also pretty awesome. You can do all sorts of neat things that Macs can't, like join a Windows server domain. You don't have Media Center, but you're using this in a business. Why does it matter?</li>
  	<li>Enterprise - If you work in a large, IT-managed corporation, you'll probably use this. Plus, since IT manages your desktop, you don't even have the opportunity of 'getting confused' by the myriad Vista SKUs.</li>
  	<li>Ultimate - OK, so I take back everything I said before about Business. You have a domain. And want Media Center. Plus, you want <a href="http://windowsultimate.com/Default.aspx">the coolest, most exclusive features around</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  So, if you're a casual computer user and happen to see this ad on TV, the list of Vista options you should care about are:
  <ul>
  	<li>Home Basic - want to send email, see some photos, browse the web, and maybe write a letter here and there? This is probably pretty good for your needs. Checking Dell right now reveals that a Vista machine with Home Basic will cost you about $350. Let me know when you can buy a brand new Mac for the same price.</li>
  	<li>Home Premium - want to do all the stuff I talked about with Home Basic, plus you might want to play some games here and there, or make dvds, or hi-def movies? Home Premium is probably about right for you. You can buy a computer from Dell with this OS for about $600 (about the same price as Apple's cheapest computer)</li>
  	<li>Ultimate - Call your computer a rig? Know the difference between HDMI and component? Buy computers from companies like Alienware? This is probably the right edition for you. </li>
  </ul>
  Just to review, computers equipped with these three versions of Windows Vista seem to fall into a couple different price categories: sub-$500, $600 - $2000, and loads of moolah. You just have to ask yourself: which price point is right for you when it comes to buying a new computer? The rest is pretty much handled.

  Oh yeah, and Vista really isn't the anti-christ, <a href="http://www.nik.com.au/archives/2007/05/06/switching-back/trackback/">as Nik Cubrilovic was nice enough to point out</a>:
  <blockquote>I didn’t expect it to be like this, I didn’t <strong>want</strong> Vista to be this good - I was expecting to boot back into OS X and living happily ever after, but damn, this is one fast, slick and nice operating system. If you are a Mac user try it yourself, install <a href="http://www.apple.com/bootcamp"><font color="#004276">boot camp</font></a> and Vista and it will feel like you just added another CPU and doubled your RAM - I can’t see any evidence for any of the reports of Vista being slow or power-hungry.</blockquote>
