My friend Jen, executive administrator extraordinaire, goes by the name LP Trixie on MSN Messenger. I asked her about this a week or so ago, only to discover Chicago's most elite social organization: the Lincoln Park Trixies.

  What is an LP Trixie? They drive Jettas, drink double tall non-fat Lattes, and show the world who's boss. They're the women you want.

  The LP Trixie website addresses such serious concerns as what to do after you let slip to your crush that you think Dave Matthews is overrated, how long you should put off buying an Afghan hound in support of our war on terror, and other such pertinent, important issues.

  Thanks, Lincoln Park Trixies! You've made the world a better place!
