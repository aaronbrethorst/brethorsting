There are a few key things I want to learn a lot more about in 2011. In particular, they are:
<ul>
	<li>State-of-the-art Javascript: Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Coffeescript, and some more Sproutcore for good measure.</li>
	<li>JVM/JVM-alike: Scala and Android SDK (not necessarily together).</li>
</ul>
