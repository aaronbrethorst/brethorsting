Charles Petzold, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg">tha doggfather</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Petzold">Windows programming</a>, published <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/12/250913.html">a few choice words</a> about how Macs "just worked" back in December:
  <blockquote>On Apple's home page, the most important information they deemed necessary to convey to me was that I needed QuickTime 7 to view even more of those insufferable TV ads where that smug goateed glazy-eyed dork tries to make closed architecture and a complete disregard for backward compatibility seem cool. </blockquote>

  Remember that for a large portion of your potential user base, 'easy to use' is still too damned hard, even if they have forgotten more about Win32 than you'll ever know about Cocoa.
