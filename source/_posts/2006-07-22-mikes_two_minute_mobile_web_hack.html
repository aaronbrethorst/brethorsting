Mike Davidson, fellow Seattleite and CEO of <a href="http://www.newsvine.com">Newsvine</a>, has <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/07/make-your-site-mobile-friendly">a handy tutorial</a> on making your website mobile device-friendly in just a couple minutes. His approach, in contrast to the potentially unsupported approach of using 'mobile device web standards,' makes extensive use of server-side rules and code to pummel your website into a format that even the most braindead mobile web browser can render.

  Step 0: Follow standard guidelines for separating presentation from content using XHTML and CSS (duh).
  Step 1: Create a domain mirror
  Step 2: Create a global prepend function
  Step 3: Create a global append function
  Step 4: Enable global use of these prepend and append functions with .htaccess.

  Snazzy stuff, and how often do you find a CEO who can still hack code with the best of them? ;-)
