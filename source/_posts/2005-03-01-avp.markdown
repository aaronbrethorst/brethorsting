I just finished watching Alien vs. Predator, and I seriously think it's in the running for &lt;Comic Book Guy&gt;Worst Movie Ever&lt;/Comic Book Guy&gt;. This movie seriously transcends normal concepts of badness. God forbid that it would have any continuity with the six fucking other movies that has something to do with this (especially since several of those were horrible), but it stole shot after shot from Aliens. I mean, seriously, I spent half of the movie expecting the main character (some chick whose name I never actually caught) to shout out "get away from her you bitch!" argh. At least Terminator 3's ending surprised me. This movie just kind of pissed me off.

  Overall rating: * out of 5 stars, and if I could have given it a negative value I would've.
