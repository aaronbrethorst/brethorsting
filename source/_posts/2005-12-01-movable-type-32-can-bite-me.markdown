Without a doubt, my absolute favorite keyboard shortcut in IE 6 is Alt+D, which moves focus to the address bar. Movable Type 3.2, which I just installed, thoughtfully overrides this keyboard shortcut with its access key for Delete. Sigh. C'mon guys, you could've used Alt+L just as easily (and although it's less obvious) at least it wouldn't have conflicted with this shortcut. This is really irritating.
