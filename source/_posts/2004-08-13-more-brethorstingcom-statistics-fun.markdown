Here are a few Google searches from my statistics page from yesterday:

  "aaron brethorst" - someone actually googled me. I'm touched.
  "funniest picture ever" - I still come up amazingly high for this one.
  "irooster windows" - There's definitely a lot of interest in this, and I do aim to please. Eventually.
  "visual c 3.0 download crack" - This last one has me a bit confused. I'm guessing that they're actually looking for a crack for eMbedded Visual C++ 3.0. This is sort of weird, though, since the last version of this was actually v4.0, and the serial number for this is available on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=1DACDB3D-50D1-41B2-A107-FA75AE960856
  ">microsoft.com</a>. Perhaps I misunderstand, and the person in question really is looking for a crack for VC 3.0. If this really is the case, then I highly suggest they try downloading <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/visualc/">Visual C++ Express 2005 Beta 1</a>, aka version 8.0.

  oh well...
