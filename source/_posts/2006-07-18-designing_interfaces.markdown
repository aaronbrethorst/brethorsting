  Jennifer Tidwell, a UI designer at a major mathematical/scientific software company, has written what is, in my opinion, <em>the</em> book on UI Design Patterns. This book is a fantastic resource for quickly and easily replicating standardized experiences for your software's user interface. It also doesn't hurt that Jennifer pulls a number of examples from Visual Studio :-).
