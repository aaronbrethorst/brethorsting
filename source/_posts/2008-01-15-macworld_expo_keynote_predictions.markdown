Here are my guesses for tomorrow morning's Stevenote:
  <ol>
  	<li>iPhone and iPod sales figures have surpassed the Street's expectations.</li>
   	<li>Mac sales figures have surpassed the Street's expectations.</li>
  	<li>16GB iPhone</li>
  	<li>iPhone SDK</li>
  	<li>Apple TV 2.0 and iTunes movie rentals</li>
  	<li>No mention of 10.6 outside of "we're working on it."</li>
  	<li>Ultra-portable MacBook</li>
  	<li>Option for built-in 3G wireless data on the ultra-portable and Pro lines</li>
  	<li>Steve reveals he's actually Cthulu, and that Eric Schmidt's really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yog-Sothoth">Yog-Sothoth</a>.</li>
  	<li>iPhone gets new/upgraded apps, including Google Maps with some sense of location awareness</li>
  </ol>
