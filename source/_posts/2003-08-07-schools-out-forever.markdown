well, just about. I just got my grade for statistics, and I did far better than I could have expected, given that I never went to class, and all I wanted to do was pass it. As things stand now, all I need to do is get a grade for my Advanced Project Lab (Csci 4970, baby) and I will be a college grad. I have been saying things like "Oh, I'll be done with school within a couple weeks" without really believing it. Now it looks like it really will be just a couple weeks. What a relief.
