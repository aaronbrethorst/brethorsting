I just installed a Lightbox plugin for WordPress, and I wanted to see how well it works before doing more "real" stuff with it (whatever <em>that</em> means). My girlfriend, Helen, and I wandered over to Discovery Park, a beautiful park on the western edge of Seattle, on Labor Day. We spent a few hours walking around and snapping pictures. Here areÂ a few of my favorites:
