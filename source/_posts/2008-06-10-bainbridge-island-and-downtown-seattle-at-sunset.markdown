Friday evening found me on the ferry from Seattle to Bainbridge Island and back. I took some pictures with my new Canon 40D, and came out with nine that I was particularly happy with. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157605547101628/">The full set is up on Flickr</a>, but you can see my two favorites below.
