<a href="http://www.reverb10.com/december-9-party/">December 9 – Party  Prompt: Party</a>. <em>What social gathering rocked your socks off in 2010? Describe the people, music, food, drink, clothes, shenanigans.</em>

This is sort of sad to say, but I don't really remember going to any parties that really knocked my socks off this year: NYE was technically in 2009. I missed my 10 year high school reunion because of inclement weather and a general sense of apathy. I didn't go to any conferences this year.

Huh, I guess I'm just boring. And, to top it off, I don't have any plans for NYE 2010/2011 yet, either. I'm sure Naomi and I will sort something out for that, ultimately.
