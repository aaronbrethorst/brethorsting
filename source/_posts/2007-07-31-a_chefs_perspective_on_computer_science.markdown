My boss, John, was recently <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0%2c1895%2c2163953%2c00.asp">interviewed by eWeek</a> for an article about Popfly, where it came from, and where it's going. Here's one of my favorite quotes from the article:
  <blockquote>[Part] of the thing about learning to program is at the end you want to be able to show somebody something. It's like learning how to cook. At the end you want to be able to show somebody, hey, look at this cool thing I did, or taste this dish, it's really good.  

  I kind of felt like a lot of computer science curricula you ended up at the end with nicely chopped onions, nicely chopped carrots, nicely chopped celery and maybe you put it in a sauté pan you wound up with a sofrito, but you hadn't actually finished the dish. And I was more interested in getting to the point where you made the dish [by enabling non-programmers to skip to the end of the process].</blockquote>
