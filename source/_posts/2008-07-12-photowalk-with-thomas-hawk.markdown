As I mentioned before, there was a photowalk starting at Pike's Place Market in downtown Seattle yesterday. I took a few hundred pictures, and ended up with a handful that I thought were worth putting online. As always, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157606116368646/">you can find the full set on Flickr</a>.
