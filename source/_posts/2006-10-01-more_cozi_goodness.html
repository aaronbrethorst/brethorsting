OK, I gotta admit it: I really do like <a href="http://www.cozi.com">Cozi Central</a>. If it wasn't for the fact that I am a single male, aged 24, I would be using this thing non-stop. Unfortunately(?), I have no wife and no kids. Whew. Maybe that's not such a bad thing after all.

  What I'd love to see come out of Jan and co. is an application that helps me manage my life. Outlook can, in theory, do parts of it for me, but it's way too cumbersome. Here's my problem: I work 12 hours a day, plus a couple hours on weekends. I need to be reminded about things as mundane as "I need to go buy more milk, because I'm out, and it'd be really nice if I could remember to water the plants, since they're about to die. Oh yeah, and since it's the first of the month, I better go pay my rent right now (speaking of which...)." I don't have the spare cycles necessary to remember any of the easy parts of my life, and an application that could help me manage these things would be worth just about any price for me.

  Here's a partial list of things I need to be reminded about, and things I need to track:
  - Paying the rent (reminder for the last day of the month, every month)
  - Paying other bills
  - Where are my friends tonight, or this weekend (Evite+MySpace-esque system integrated into my calendar)
  - Groceries I need to go pick up (hell, I'd love to be able to just order them through a rich-client front-end for Safeway.com)
  - Birthdays, with integrated amazon.com wishlists, if available.
  - Fun events around the city (Seattle's replete with interesting goings-on, which I never seem to make it out to)

  So, perhaps this application could be called "Cozi Overworked, Unmarried Program Manager Life Tracker." It's not the catchiest name around, but sometimes over-descriptiveness can be useful...

  On another note, my previous quips about Cozi seem to have made it onto <a href="http://blogs.cozi.com/">the front page of the Cozi blog</a>. Check out the sidebar, around the bottom. My comments are embedded right in between Forbes and Slacker-moms-r-us :-)
