I've been accused in the reviews of Election '08 of demonstrating a pro-Obama bias in the listed polls. Here are a few facts:
<ol>
	<li>Yes, I'm a liberal. Duh.</li>
	<li>I'm not going to change your mind about who to vote for by publishing this app.</li>
	<li>I will sell more copies of Election '08 if it has no bias.</li>
	<li>I'd rather have your money than not.</li>
	<li>Yes, Obama's ahead in the polls. That's why things look rosier for him in the app.</li>
	<li>Version 1.1 (coming out as soon as Apple posts it) will show you the sources of the data, which includes pollsters such as Survey USA (who have been very accurate this year).</li>
</ol>
