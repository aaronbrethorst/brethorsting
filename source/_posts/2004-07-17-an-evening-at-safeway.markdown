I was at Safeway last night buying a container of shaving cream. It had been four days or so since I last shaved and I was in dire need of it. The couple in front of me in line was really quite interesting.

  The woman had a huge hickey on the side of her neck, and her husband was making it really clear that it was only a supreme act of self-control that kept him from taking her right then and there in the middle of the checkout line.

  This, in and of itself, is really not that interesting or strange. Instead, what caught my attention were the two items they were purchasing. What type of odd scenario requires a tube of Astroglide lube and a pint of half-and-half? Hmm, on second thought I don't think I really want that answered.

  Then again, maybe they just really like a post-coital cup of coffee.
