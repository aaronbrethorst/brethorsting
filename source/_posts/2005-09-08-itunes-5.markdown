So, in case you haven't heard yet, iTunes 5 kills brushed metal dead. <em>Thank. Fucking. God.</em> Of course, this means that I have to go back and figure out how to duplicate this for iRooster, which will be an abolute pain in the ass. Oh well.

  My renouncement of brushed metal made a fairly well-known Mac guy happy earlier today. Also, John Gruber of Daring Fireball has <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/09/anthropomorphized">a wonderfully funny jab at Apple</a> over this:

  <blockquote>
  <em>[T]he phone rings. Brushed Metal picks it off the passenger seat and looks at the caller ID. It reads: AQUA. Brushed Metal takes the call.

  Brushed Metal: What do you want?

  (It’s not yet 10 a.m., but Aqua is drunk.)

  Aqua: Howdya fuckin’ like it now, bee-yotch? WHOO HOO!

  Brushed Metal: Fuck you, Aqua.

  Aqua: WHOOO!

  Cut to black.</em>
