Mauricio Perez, a Microsoft Technical Account Manager (or TAM), has an extensive survey of creating an effective User Experience for Windows Mobile 5.0 devices at <a href="http://www.windowsfordevices.com/articles/AT4228820897.html">WindowsForDevices.com</a>. The article is fairly broad, covering everything from the evolution of the Windows Mobile UI, to control layout for finger-operation. This is both good and bad, as it prevents the article from making deep dives into any specific area, but it is a great jumping-off point for anyone building mobile applications.

  I've been using Windows Mobile devices for the past few years now, first with a Smartphone 2002 (Motorola MPX200), then Smartphone 2003 SE (HTC Typhoon), and now Windows Mobile 5 - PocketPC (T-Mobile MDA). The greatest headaches I've found are:
  <ul>
  <li>applications that try to cram too much information into a single window,</li>
  <li>applications that feel like they were ported directly from Windows, and</li>
  <li>applications that are not designed for one-handed, finger-based manipulation (Phone UI, I'm looking at <em>you</em>).</li>
  </ul>

  Hopefully, with guidance like this out there, the mobile application experience will steadily improve.
