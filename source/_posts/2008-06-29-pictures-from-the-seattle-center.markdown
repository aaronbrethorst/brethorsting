Got busy yesterday: hit up <a href="http://www.glazerscamera.com/">Glazer's Camera</a> for a price and weight comparison on three Canon 'L' lenses: the 17-40, 27-40 and 24-105. I decided that I will pick up the 24-70L as soon as my finances allow it. I'm certainly not willing to pay Glazer's $130 price difference over Amazon for the sake of having the lens right now, though it would've been fun to have yesterday.

After I finished up at Glazer's with another 4GB CF card and a 3-stop ND filter, I wandered over to the Seattle Center, and shot the pictures below. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157603652306749/">There are a few more on Flickr</a>, too.
