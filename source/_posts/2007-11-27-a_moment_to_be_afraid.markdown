Up is down! White is black! Cats and dogs living in sin! <em>Program Managers doing graphic design work</em>! The horror!

  My friend Doug, one of our Product Managers on Visual Studio Express, contacted me in a bit of a panic a few weeks ago. It turns out that they were launching a brand-new Visual Studio Express website for 2008 release, and they really wanted to put <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/popfly/Default.aspx">a Popfly page on there</a>.

  Unfortunately, there was no one to do the graphic design for it. So, I got tapped. I think I did a decent job, given that I only had a few hours, but it's still simply terrifying to think that people confuse me with a designer. hah!
