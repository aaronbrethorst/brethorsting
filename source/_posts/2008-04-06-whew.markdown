I'll have much more to say this week than I have in a while. I hate these self-imposed quiet periods :P In other news, I attended the rockin' 43rd LD's caucuses, which was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterjhill/2391384862/in/pool-43rddems">an absolute madhouse</a> (but in a good way). I also finally got my hair cut today, which is critical due to my impending vacation to Japan in six (and counting) days. I also had a occasion to take <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157604420501489/">more pictures</a> today, of which I saved three. Less lame stuff coming soon, I promise.
