I had dinner with Helen, her friend Kat, and Kat's boyfriend, Kirk, last night at <a href="http://www.rovers-seattle.com/">Rover's</a>. For those of you who haven't heard of it, let me tell you three things:
  1. Bring your entire last paycheck to pay for it.
  2. Bring an appetite.
  3. Bring a stretcher, you'll need it by the time you leave.

  This was, quite possibly, the single best dinner I've ever had in my life. It was also rather pricy; not unreasonably so, given what we had (4 meals, 2 glasses of wine for me, plus a half-bottle for Kat and Kirk, and a pair of espresso drinks at the end), but it's still somewhat frightening to see a $600 bill at the end of the night.

  Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly an experience well worth having. Take a look at <a href="http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/10789954/seattle_wa/rover_s.html">Citysearch's opinion</a>, too.
