<a href="http://www.tantek.com/log/2006/10.html#d05t1826">Tantek Ã‡elik and Leah Culver competed in the Yahoo Hack Day competition a couple weeks back, and won a 30GB iPod for their trouble</a>. Their 2nd place-taking hack combined the Yahoo Mail APIs with Flickr and a Greasemonkey script, which would send a Flickr photo to a friend as an ecard. Pretty cool stuff, actually.

  You can play around with the hack using the instructions on Tantek's website, if you feel so inclined. <a href="http://leahculver.com/">Meanwhile, help Leah buy a new laptop by purchasing laser-etched advertising rights on its case</a> at the price of $50/square inch. I might actually do this with iRooster...
