I am phenomenally tired today. My friend Marie demanded to use my Wifi until 12:30 or 1:00 am today, and then got outside to discover her car had been towed (word of advice: never park on the corner of Lee St and 1st Ave W in Upper Queen Anne, or face the wrath of the Seattle PD).

  Being the incredibly nice person that I am, I offered to drive her down to the impound lot. 140 dollars later, and she had her car back (quoth Marie: "140 bucks!? I could buy a pair of pants with that!").

  In other news, <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpagesscreens/918766.asp?screenid=10">Katamari Damacy</a> for PS2 looks rather interesting, and it's only $20 to boot. If any place in Seattle actually had a copy I'd buy it.

  Also, not that anyone cares, but all of my friends have finally started their slow, inexorable move out of Minneapolis. It's good to see so many of them finally making it out of there.

  Stef and Justin - Boston
  Elize - Port Townsend WA
  Tony and Liz - Eastern Europe(?)
  Afton - China
  Kelly - New York
  Sayra - Germany
  Well, you get the idea. Congrats, all!
