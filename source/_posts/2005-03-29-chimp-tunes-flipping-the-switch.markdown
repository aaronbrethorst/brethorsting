Visiting <a href="http://www.chimptunes.com">www.chimptunes.com</a> will now take you to the Chimp Tunes website on <a href="http://www.sixdollarchimp.com/">sixDollarChimp</a>.

  Also, I have now added an RSS feed for each of the four Chimp Tunes categories that have been defined. I've been using them for a while now in my aggregator (<a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a>, in case any cares) and it's pretty cool to see what people are listening to, as they listen to it.

  I need to look into building some kind of hook into my MT installation to show the last five songs played on the side here. That'd be kinda fun :)

  More Chimp Tunes stuff coming as fast as I can dream it up and implement it (the latter is proving to be more of a sticky point than the former... I have tons of ideas at this point about how to improve Chimp Tunes).
