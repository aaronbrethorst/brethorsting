I just found this article on <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_957945.html">Ananova</a>: <em>We are not talking retarded people here, but a couple who were brought up in a religious environment who were simply unaware, after eight years of marriage, of the physical requirements necessary to procreate.</em> Basically, this German couple went to a fertility clinic where the doctors discovered that they simply hadn't tried having sex. wow. that's just kinda freaky.
