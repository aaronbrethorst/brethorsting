I had a terrific time at Tech Ed in Orlando last week, although I'm afraid that my liver is a bit under the weather now. I'm not going to bother rehashing the million other things that have already been said about it, except to plug the podcast video taken with me at the conference (<a href="http://casting.dlservice.microsoft.com/download/5/7/2/572011dd-298a-4936-af67-8f3596d0a3b2/VisualStudio2005_demo.wmv">available here</a>), and say that there is more to come on this topic from a more personal level.
