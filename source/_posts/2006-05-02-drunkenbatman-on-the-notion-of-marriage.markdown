I was just chatting with <a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com">Drunkenbatman</a> on Messenger. What follows is a lightly edited copy of our conversation.

  drunkenbatman says:
  was dealing with some wedding stuff
  aaron says:
  huh?
  aaron says:
  who's getting married?
  drunkenbatman says:
  cousin
  aaron says:
  ah ok
  aaron says:
  thought you were going to say you were, there, for a sec
  drunkenbatman says:
  oh hells no.
  drunkenbatman says:
  hells. no.
  aaron says:
  :-)
  drunkenbatman says:
  thanks for ruining my evening by even suggesting that
  drunkenbatman says:
  hells. fucking. no.

  Sorry ladies, looks like you're all out of luck.
