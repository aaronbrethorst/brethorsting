Halo 2, KOTOR 2, Half-Life 2, Metal Gear Solid 3, Fable...

  These are all of the games I'm getting between now and the end of the year. I have absolutely no clue how I will have a chance to play, let alone beat, every title listed. Too many cool games, too llittle time.

  Interesting thing, though: of the five games, 1 is for PC, 1 is for PS2, and 3 are for XBox. Can you tell what console I favor? ;-)
