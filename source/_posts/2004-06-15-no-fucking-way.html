So I just had someone really unexpected buy iRooster. Suffice it to say, I <i>really</i> don't like his music, he's been on TRL a lot, and you've undoubtedly heard of his band. Weird. Just profoundly fucking weird. Anyway, I salute you, mystery musician. Thanks for supporting this young software developer.
