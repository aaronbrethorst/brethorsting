I'm revising the look and feel of my blog. Please let me know if anything looks particularly wonky, or if something is egregiously broken.

  Also, just as a followup from my tale of laptop woe the other day, I wanted to mention that I ordered a slightly-older MacBook after Apple rev'd the specs on their consumer laptop line yesterday. Luckily for me, I was able to swoop in and get a fantastic deal on a black MacBook from Amazon. I'm very excited; it'll be very cool to have a Mac laptop whose battery lasts longer than an hour.
