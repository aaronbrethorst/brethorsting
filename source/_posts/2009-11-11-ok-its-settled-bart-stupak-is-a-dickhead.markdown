I just kind of assumed he was a garden variety jerkoff before, but this clinches the deal for me. <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/11/stupak-sought-to-limit-abortions-to-cases-of-forcible-rape-in-health-care-reform.php">Bart Stupak is seriously a dickhead</a>:

<blockquote>A day before the bill passed out of committee, Stupak co-sponsored, and voted for an amendment written by Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA)--distinct from the now notorious "Stupak amendment"--that would have limited the government's ability to include abortions in benefits plans to cases of incest, life of the mother, and forcible rape.</blockquote>
