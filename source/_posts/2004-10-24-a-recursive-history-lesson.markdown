This is from <a href="http://jameswolcott.com/">James Wolcott</a> by way of the always incredible <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2004_10_01_archive.asp#109865313568004381">William Gibson</a> (yes, that one): "The savage Iraq insurgency, a tragedy for the Iraqi people and the Americans and other foreigners who have been victims there, has unwound the future in ways we still can't understand."

  Incidentally, <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com">Josh Marshall</a> goes into depth today on how an American planning SNAFU (i.e. something the White House and Pentagon are responsible for) led to militants getting access to 350 tons (TONS, jesus...) of high-powered explosives. Freaky stuff.
