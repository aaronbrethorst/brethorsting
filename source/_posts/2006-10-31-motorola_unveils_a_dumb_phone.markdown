It seems almost painfully obvious, in a way, but some people don't actually want more features, doodads, gizmos, or gewgaws sticking out of their phone (admittedly, I'm not one of them: I still want GPS, 3G data, Wi-Fi, and a qwerty keyboard on my Windows Mobile phone). For them, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17663&ch=nanotech&sc=">Motorola has just unveiled the Motofone</a>, which features such battery-saving novelties as an e-ink screen, while still retaining a good bit of Moto's recent aesthetic awesomeness:
  <blockquote>[Motorola] hopes the design will help win new customers in large emerging markets, such as India, where there isn't yet a "signature product" equivalent to the Razr...The phone may also appeal to new users in countries such as the United States, he says, or to anyone who just wants a simple phone that works well.</blockquote>
