<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/08/16/android-and-the-internet-of-things/">Erick Schonfeld of TechCrunch wrote this followup</a> to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/08/15/android-wants-to-be-on-any-device-not-just-your-phone/">a recent post on VentureBeat</a>:
<blockquote>VentureBeat’s Eric Eldon reports:<em>Industry sources tell us that although Android will indeed start as a mobile OS, Google intends to expand it to be a sort of universal operating system that will span set-top boxes for televisions, mp3 players and other communication and media devices and services.</em>

If what Eldon is hearing is true, that means that Android could one day spread beyond mobile phones and set-top boxes to a multiplicity of devices.</blockquote>
Isn't this the kind of quality investigative journalism you'd expect from a publication <a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/2007/10/03/wow-were-worth-100-million/">reputedly worth a cool one hundred million dollars</a> (or more)? I mean, VentureBeat says that Google will expand Android onto STBs, MP3 players, and other devices, and then Erick builds his frighteningly prescient analysis on top of it: "that means that Android could one day spread beyond mobile phones and set-top boxes to a multiplicity of devices." Wow! I mean, just, wow. I could have never come up with anything as insightful as that. Thanks, Erick!
