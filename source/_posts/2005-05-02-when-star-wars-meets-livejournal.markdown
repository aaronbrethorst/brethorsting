I just found my new favorite weblog, <a href="http://darthside.blogspot.com/">The Darth Side - Memoirs of a Monster</a>: <em>...You try to be an effective manager, you weed out the bad apples like the late Admiral Ozzel -- only to find that an insidious culture of incompetence has somehow transformed your deadly pan-galactic armada into a fleet of spaceballs.</em>
