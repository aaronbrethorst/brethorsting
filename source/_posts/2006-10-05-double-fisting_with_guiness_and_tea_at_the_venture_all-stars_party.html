I attended <a href="http://www.ventureallstars.com/">the Venture All-Stars party tonight</a>, followed by a trip over to my friend Rachel's apartment to hang out and catch up. Rachel is a complete "n00b" when it comes to computers, and assumes that being <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Scobleized</a> is something rather dirty. Anyway, the point being was that it's always interesting to be in "your element" and immediately leave it for something completely removed. It's a good reminder that the blogosphere still doesn't matter to 99% of the people out there.

  I had a fantastic time at the Venture All-Stars party, in any case. I met a number of interesting people, including Brian Mulvaney and Scott Niesen from <a href="http://www.attensa.com">Attensa</a>; Buzz Bruggeman, the CEO of <a href="http://www.activewords.com/">ActiveWord Systems</a>; John Anthony Hartman, co-founder of <a href="http://www.feedia.net/">Feedia</a>; <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/about-techcrunch/">Marshall Kirkpatrick of TechCrunch</a> (me: "wow, I always assumed you were shorter and balder..." him: "I am so insulted right now" ... bear in mind, Marshall's response was paraphrased); and an old friend from college, Mike (Mikey) Graca of <a href="http://oldtownfancy.com">OldTownFancy</a>. Perhaps the most interesting person I met, though, was a usability engineer in Boeing's IT group. We had an interesting, 45 minute-long conversation about everything from French influence on Vietnam to the dynamics of consuming Guiness with tea (see posting title).

  In any case, <a href="http://www.moo.com/">the calling cards from Moo</a> were a huge hit. Marshall loved them, although I had to explain what exactly the text on the card meant several times over.

  <em>Update</em>: a couple of other things I forgot. One: Scoble did not get his free booze. His loss. Two: I also met Drew Meyers from Zillow, who turns out to be all of 23 or 24 (not that I'm any older ;-). Three: I, just like everyone else on the planet, am working on a super-secret Web 2.0 thingy, and no I won't tell you what it is.
