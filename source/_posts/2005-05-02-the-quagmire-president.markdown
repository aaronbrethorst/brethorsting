<a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/001172.php">Ruy Texiera has an interesting analysis of El Presidente's first hundred days in his second term</a>: <em>The President’s miscalculation that a 2.5 percent margin of victory in the popular vote constitutes a mandate for trashing the New Deal’s most popular program was a blunder that even has conservatives starting to use “quagmire” in describing Bush’s predicament.</em>

  There's been a flurry of blogging over the past few days about how the White House has completely botched their hatchet job on social security. We'll see how it plays out.
