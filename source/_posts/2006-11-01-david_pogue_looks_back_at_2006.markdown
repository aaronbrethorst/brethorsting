David Pogue has an article in the NY Times today about some of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/technology/circuits/01pogue.html?_r=1&oref=rss">the technological highlights of the year</a>. I find it interesting how much he hates Windows and Windows Mobile, as shown here:
  <blockquote>The turkeys of the year: Microsoft’s Ultra Mobile PC computers (too big to be palmtops and too stripped-down to be PCs — and no keyboard); Verizon’s balky Chocolate cellphone; and, thanks to its idiotically inefficient software, the Motorola Q phone.</blockquote>

  I have to protest about the supposed usability of the Motorola Q. I think it's a fantastic phone (as is the new <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=f164419f-eee9-4cf6-a1bd-070dbe4b5023">T-Mobile Dash</a>, which I just picked up last Friday. There are certainly issues with it; I won't ignore that, but I think that the usability of Windows Mobile 5 is significantly better than what you will find with the Moto Razr, for instance.
