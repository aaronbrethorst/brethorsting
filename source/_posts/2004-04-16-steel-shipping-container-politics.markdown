  Kaus definitely has a point. Bush is doing a bang-up job tearing himself apart. Strangely enough, Kerry is alsodoing a bang-up job of tearing himself apart. At the same time, Kerry is entirely capable of being kept under lock and key until election day -- or at least until he's formally nominated. It seems like less face time is key for Kerry, not more.
