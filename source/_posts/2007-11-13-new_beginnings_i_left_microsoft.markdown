About two weeks ago, I made the decision to leave Microsoft. It wasn't an easy decision for me to make, but the opportunity I had <em>handed</em> to me was one I couldn't easily pass up. I'm really going to miss my team; working on <a href="http://www.popfly.com">Popfly</a> for the past year has been a fantastic experience, and I couldn't ask for a better group of people to work with. Even so...

  Anyway, I'm going to be joining a startup here in Seattle as a front-end web developer, UI designer, usability guy and ... well, whatever else needs to be done. This means my commute will be about 15 minutes long each way instead of 45, which is quite exciting. The company is still in stealth mode, so I won't be saying too much about it for the time being.

  In other news, I'm publishing iRooster 2.5 tonight, working on getting iRooster 3.0 out the door (still), and starting final feature development and shakedown testing for a web project that I've been mulling over and talking with people about for about a year now. I think it'll be a big boon for parents, especially around this time of year, but it's something I will find incredibly useful as well. More on that soon, too. It's also somewhat stealthy right now ;-)
