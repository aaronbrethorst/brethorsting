<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2087206/">Jim Holt</a>: "I know people who still regard atoms as theoretical fictions. I have friends who claim to doubt the reality of the past, of the future, of other minds. I have heard of academics—though I cannot believe they actually exist—who think that the cosmos is a social construction."

This a fun article on the notion of multiverses over at Slate today.

In other news, <a href="http://www.sixdollarchimp.com">sixdollarchimp</a> is at 1500 hits and climbing for the day due to iRooster being listed on Apple's Mac OS X downloads and on VersionTracker. I have received a bajillion requests for wake-from-sleep from people today. Not surprisingly, this is most definitely coming in a point release or two. Hopefully in 1.1, but we'll see.
