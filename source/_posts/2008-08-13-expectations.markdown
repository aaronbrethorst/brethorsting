I'm a little worried that I may be a little over-excited about Bethesda Softworks' upcoming title, <a href="http://fallout.bethsoft.com/eng/home/home.php?fbid=34UE7">Fallout 3</a>...and by that, I really mean that if this game is anything less than <strong>THE BEST GODDAMNED GAME EVER RELEASED I AM GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! </strong>So um, yeah.

Fallout and Fallout 2 are on my top 10 list of favorite games, and I'd love to see their sequel be just as good, if not better. So far, though, it looks spectacular, and all of the early previews suggest it'll be excellent. Fingers crossed.
