Aaron Schock is the newest—and youngest at 27 years old—member of the incoming Congressional class. It took some work to dig up anything about him.

<a href="http://www.aaronschock.com/">His campaign website</a> is devoid of anything resembling position statements, and instead contains your average smattering of broad, meaningless platitudes. 

Here's what I do know about Aaron, now:
<ul>
	<li>Aaron will be representing IL-18, a lean-Republican district encompassing Peoria (Cook PVI R+5), with a 90.8% white population, and a 6.5% African-American population, and a completely middle-of-the-road average income (about $42,000, ranking it #222 out of 435 CDs) [<a href="http://watchdog.net/us/il-18">Watchdog</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_18th_congressional_district">Wikipedia</a>]. Still, he cut at least one TV ad pushing very, very hard for the African-American community's vote [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9xJ5N6shEg">YouTube</a>].</li>
	<li>Aaron <a href="http://archpundit.com/blog/2007/11/08/daily-dolt-aaron-schock-fighting-non-proliferation-with-proliferation/">suggested last year</a> that we should sell nuclear weapons to Taiwan if China didn't go along with our policy on Iran. Here's the money quote: "If China continues to be irresponsible about nuclear proliferation in Iran, we should tell them that if they do not care about proliferation — and since they are enablers of it in Iran — that if they don’t change their position, we will sell Pershing nuclear missiles to Taiwan for their defense."</li>
	<li><a href="http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/can_give/H8IL18043">Aaron accepted contributions</a> from your typical array of Republican donor-sources: NRA, Big Oil, credit and banking firms, etc.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=13438&amp;can_id=33428">Aaron voted against a law</a> that would have repealed Illinois' absolute requirement for parental notification of abortion.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=13549&amp;can_id=33428">Aaron voted against allowing stem cell research</a> while banning human cloning.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=33428">Aaron received a score of 25</a> from the Illinois Civil Justice League, a 44 and a 20, respectively, for the Illinois Environmental Council and Illinois League of Conservation Voters, but he did receive an A from the NRA. Astonishingly, he voted in the interests of the AFL-CIO 51% of the time.</li>
</ul>
I'll leave you with <a href="http://aaronschock.com/stand.html">a quote from Aaron's website</a>:
<blockquote>The accomplishments of the Republican Majority in Congress since 1994 are astonishing and every American lives a better life today because of those changes made with that historic majority.</blockquote>
