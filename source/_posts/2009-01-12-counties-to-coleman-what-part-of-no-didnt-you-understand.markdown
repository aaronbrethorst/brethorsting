<blockquote>So far, the counties appear to have sorted through about 150 ballots from Coleman's list of 650 [incorrectly managed ballots], and they've come up with one discrepancy. At this pace, Coleman is on track to get a grand total of ... 4 additional ballots counted. Given his luck, they'll probably turn out to be Franken votes.</blockquote>
