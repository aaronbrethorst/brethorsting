I'm not really, but it sounded like a half-decent blog title.

  <strong>1. Life</strong>
  Life is good, by and large. I'm a bit more overworked than usual, but I can't say I'm too surprised by this. It won't last more than another 5-6 weeks, so that's really not the end of the world. Besides, when I am really busy I have less time to spend money, and that's never a bad thing, really ;-).

  Seriously, though, I spent the bulk of the weekend with Jamie, as always. We saw Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow on Friday. I can't recommend it highly enough. It was a hell of a lot of fun.

  Yesterday we went to the REI flagship store here in Seattle. The thing is fucking HUGE! I needed a good, reliable rain+cold weather jacket, and the $40 thing I bought at the Gap wasn't cutting it anymore. It's funny, but living here requires certain types of clothing that you wouldn't even consider in Minnesota.

  Typical winter garb in MN was:
  - Boxers
  - Thermal Underwear
  - 1 or 2 pairs of socks (seriously)
  - Shitty leather shoes that cost me twenty bucks when I was in high school
  - Jeans
  - a t-shirt
  - thermal underwear top
  - a wool sweater
  - possibly a vest
  - a scarf
  - one or two hats depending on the day (I had an ultra-thin Helly Hansen that I would put under a wool cap)
  - gloves, or preferably mittens

  This is what you need to safely wander around outside in Minneapolis in the middle of January without getting cold.

  Seattle, on the other hand, requires less attire:
  - Boxers
  - Socks
  - Jeans
  - Shoes that are semi water-resistant
  - T-shirt
  - A Fleece, preferably from North Face or Columbia.
  - Rain- and wind-proof jacket, preferably from North Face or Columbia.

  Anyway, you get the idea. The trick is that Seattle doesn't get that cold, but the air is more damp, and therefore bone-chilling than in Minnesota.

  Long story short, I bought a $200 jacket from REI that should last me until the end of time.

  <strong>2. iRooster</strong>
  I released 1.2 Beta 3 the other day. I have two major bugs to track down and squash, and then it's RTM time! Woo-hoo! I seriously can't wait. I've been wanting to investigate a few other projects for months now, and it's finally looking more realistic.

  <strong>3. Work</strong>
  As you may know, we released Visual Studio 2005 Beta 1 Refresh the other day. This is Beta 1 + the Team System components. Very cool stuff. Like I said before, work's nuts, but it'll chill a little in the next couple months.

  <strong>4. Video Games</strong>
  It's started. Fable came out last week. Half-Life is at release candidate. By the time I'm done with Fable, I should have a shit-ton of other games to start playing (you can see the list below).

  w00t!
