A few quick things to toss out there. iRooster 2.0 will, without a doubt, be Panther-only. I have zero clue what the timeframe is for that right now. For the time being, I think I have to use the kludgy PMU property setter interface (blergh). From the look of it, as long as you authenticate yourself as an administrator to iRooster there will never be any problems. People without administrative access can't set the PMU for wakeups >600 seconds. At least, this is what I'm inferring from the eziggy/jrc comments from before.

Ethan/eziggy, if you have a chance I'd love to talk to you via email about the PM stuff in more depth. My email address is on my <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/resume.html">resume</a>.

Once I commit myself to killing off pre-10.3 compatibility there won't be any nasty lingering kludgy PMU code, and everything'll be all kosher-like.

We're certainly not talking 18 months here, or anything along those lines. Probably more like 6-8 months, absolute tops. I have a bunch of features to ramrod into versions 1.1, 1.2, and probably 1.3. Localizations (which looks like German, Italian, Icelandic [don't ask], French, Spanish, and a few others at this point) will find their way into iRooster somewhere in the 1.2/1.3 timeframe as a gradual addition.

I am very thoroughly addicted to waking up to iRooster, btw. I remember now how terrible my clock radio really is, given that it gets bad reception, and plays bad music. I'd wake up to public radio, but it has a bad tendency to put me back to sleep. I woke up this morning to Ben Folds in CD quality sound. I'm sure my downstairs neighbor hates me right now.
