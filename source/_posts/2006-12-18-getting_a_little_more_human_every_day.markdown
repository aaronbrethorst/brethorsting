I spoke too soon the other day when I complained about <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/12/when_clarity_is_the_antigoal_1.html">the Geek Squad's new automated phone system</a>. I received an email from Robert Stephens, the company's founder, earlier today informing me that he had read my blog, and was indeed fixing the problems I had outlined. Robert wants to hew to the <a href="http://gethuman.com/standard/v1.0.html">gethuman standard v1.0</a>, which I think is quite commendable. Thanks for the follow-up, Robert, it's great to know you haven't lost your obsession with perfection :)
