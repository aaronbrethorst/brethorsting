Not my photo, but still very fitting. All of my blessings and best wishes to everyone wearing an American flag around the world, and...well, honestly, what I was going to say seemed trite. Instead, just spend a moment thinking about those who have sacrificed their lives or health for the ideals our country represents. I wholeheartedly respect what they have done on our behalf.

Happy Memorial Day.
