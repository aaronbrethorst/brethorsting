I've started on a <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com">site redesign</a>, as you may have noticed. So far, the main page of the site and my r&#233;sum&#233; have been converted over. Still to come: the (woefully out of date) Code section, this Weblog, Photos, and the nonexistent About page.

  Additionally, I finally finished moving <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/gallery">all of my pictures</a> over to the Gallery 2 install I have, instead of the brutally awful iPhoto-generated page I was using before.
