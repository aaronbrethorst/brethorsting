As everyone and their mother probably knows, now, Microsoft is planning on releasing an iPod competitor in time for Christmas 2006. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/21/zune-what-we-know-think-we-know-and-dont-yet-know/">According to Engadget</a>, <a href="http://comingzune.com/">Zune</a> is actually the name of the brand and the device, and there are, supposedly, more Zune devices coming in 2007.

  What Zune brings to the table is an '<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/21/microsoft-portable-to-be-a-totally-integrated-experience/">integrated experience</a>,' where Microsoft provides the backend software, the media service, and the hardware in order to give end-users a better experience than they'd receive with a mix-and-match configuration, of the type you usually get with the Windows/PlaysForSure paradigm today.

  I hasten to point out that I know nothing more than I've read online, but I'm enough of a gadget junkie to put in a pre-order as soon as I know what I can actually order. Also, I've been dying to use some sort of bad pun as a headline and link to that damned tiny guy+bunny flash viral marketing video.

  Update - <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/07/27/imagination">A quote from Mark Pilgrim on Zune:</a>
  <blockquote>In tech news, Microsoft has announced a brilliant plan to kill the iPod. They won’t actually tell anybody what it is, and it won’t be compatible with anything else, and it has something to do with a creepy guy stroking a bunny. It’s like I don’t even need to be here. This stuff just writes itself.</blockquote>
