<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/223149.php">From Josh Marshall</a>:
<blockquote>When this is all over I do not know whether Obama and Biden will allow McCain to meet with his testicles without preconditions.</blockquote>
Just checked the website, and apparently Josh has changed the text:
<blockquote>After the election, in the interests of national reconciliation, I imagine Obama and Biden may allow McCain to make special non-custodial visits to his testicles.</blockquote>
Not quite as funny, but it still makes the point. <em>Ouch</em>. It seems patently obvious to me, at this point, that Obama and Biden are trying to goad McCain into erupting during the third debate. Not very nice, but it wasn't very nice to insinuate that Obama pals around with terrorists. Karma, motherfucker.
