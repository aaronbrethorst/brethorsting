Periodically, I find very entertaining search queries in my referrer log for this website. Yesterday produced another gem:

  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=visual+c+express+crack&btnG=Google+Search">visual c express crack</a>. What makes me go "huh?" about this is that the Express Editions of Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 are <b>totally free</b>. Why on earth would you need a crack for it? Not to mention that there is no Visual C Express. VC++, yes. VC#, yes. But no VC Express.
