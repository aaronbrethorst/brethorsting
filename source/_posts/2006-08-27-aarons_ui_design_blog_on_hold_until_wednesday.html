I'm off to not-so-warm-and-sunny San Francisco until Tuesday night. I may have time and opportunity to post, but I'm not counting on it. See y'all Wednesday at the latest!

  In the mean time, go take a look at the following blogs I read on a regular basis:
  <a href="http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/">Wil Shipley</a>
  <a href="http://cabel.name/">Cabel Sasser</a>
  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/">Jensen Harris</a>
