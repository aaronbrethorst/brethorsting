  <em>Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32% approval rating. But guys like us, we don't pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in "reality." And reality has a well-known liberal bias.</em>

  <em>[P]ay no attention to the people who say the glass is half empty, because 32% means it's 2/3 empty. There's still some liquid in that glass is my point, but I wouldn't drink it. The last third is usually backwash.</em>

  <em>[N]o matter what happens to America, she will always rebound -- with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.</em>

  <em>Fox News gives you both sides of every story:  the president's side, and the vice president's side.</em>

  <em>Jesse Jackson is here, the Reverend...Very interesting and challenging interview...It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is.</em>
