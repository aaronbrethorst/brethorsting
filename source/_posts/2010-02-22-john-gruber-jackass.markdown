John Gruber:
<blockquote>12-word review of “A Serious Man”: So much for the Coen brothers never having made a bad movie.</blockquote>

Where by "review" Gruber means "140 characters of obnoxious drivel."

(truth be told, I haven't seen <em>A Serious Man</em> yet, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to riff on a recent DF post title ;-)
