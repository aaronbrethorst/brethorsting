<a href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~jhan/">Jeff Han, a research scientist at NYU</a>, demonstrated a prototype of a gesture-driven user interface at TED 2006. The "interface-free" UI (I <em>hate</em> terms like that) is demonstrated with several interesting demos, which hew towards data visualization in interesting ways. Apparently, the device
  <blockquote>...is force-sensitive, and provides unprecedented resolution and scalability, allowing us to create sophisticated multi-point widgets for applications large enough to accommodate both hands and multiple users.</blockquote>

  That's pretty cool, to say the least. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=PLhMVNdplJc">A ten minute video can be found at YouTube</a>.
