<em>Wisdom. What was the wisest decision you made this year, and how did it play out?</em>

Well, that's an easy one: giving up on the startup I'd put my heart and soul into for two years because it was never going to make it, and instead focusing on being a contractor, consultant and independent software developer. My business has absolutely exploded, and I can barely keep up with it.

To put it another way: the wisest decision I made all year was to trust my instincts, regardless of what sort of grievances, complaints or thinly veiled threats I was hearing from other quarters.
