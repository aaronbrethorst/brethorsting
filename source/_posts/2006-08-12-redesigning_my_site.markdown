Almost on a whim earlier tonight, I decided to rebuild my personal website from scratch. I backed up all of my content from Movable Type, installed a brand-new, spiffy copy of MT 3.31 onto my site's root and a new database, and let 'er rip. A few hours later, I think I have everything almost back to normal...except that everything is being rendered in abysmal-looking default Movable Type templates.

  Here's my plan: I want to move everything I have over to an MT-managed system. Everything. From my resume, picture galleries, a page of little free code-available software projects. This can be a little tricky, as MT doesn't seem to be well-designed to act in this context. It can be forced to work with sometimes amazing results, but it seems a little tricky.

  I spent some time looking around for inspiration and came across <a href="http://stopdesign.com/">the absolutely beautiful Stopdesign website</a>. I orignally happened upon it while looking for a MT-based solution to replace my perfectly functional, but aesthetically egregious installation of Menalto Gallery 2. <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/templates/photos/">You can see what I'm talking about</a> on Stopdesign again.
