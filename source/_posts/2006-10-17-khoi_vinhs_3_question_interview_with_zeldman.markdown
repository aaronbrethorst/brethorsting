<a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/1010_selling_jeff.php">Khoi Vinh has a three-question interview with Jeffrey Zeldman up on his website</a>. Khoi interviewed Zeldman in advance of an appearance Zeldman will be making at the Small Talks series at AIGA New York, today. Sadly it appears that the talk has been sold out since at least the 10th of October, so you're out of luck if this is the first you've heard about it.
  <blockquote> don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re doing as a profession. As a planet, we don&#8217;t seem to be doing that well. At my agency we rarely cultivate long-term relationships. This is partly down to economics, as you explain in your question. (It&#8217;s not feasible to put my team on a client&#8217;s permanent payroll.) But it&#8217;s also the nature of the work we do. We solve really big problems and then we move on. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a bad thing for anyone concerned. I think it&#8217;s a good thing.</blockquote>
