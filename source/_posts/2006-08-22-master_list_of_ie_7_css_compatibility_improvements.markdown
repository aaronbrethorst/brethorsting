Markus Mielke, a Program Manager on the Internet Explorer team, has published <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/22/712830.aspx">an exhaustively thorough list of changes to IE 7's CSS support</a> on the IE Team blog on MSDN.

  Markus also makes mention of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=D13EE10D-2718-47F1-AA86-1E32D526383D&displaylang=en">IE 7 Readiness Toolkit</a>, which provides:
  <ul>
  <li>Pointer to the latest publicly available build of Internet Explorer 7.</li>
  <li>Developer Checklist including new features and changes of interest to application and web developers should be aware of.</li>
  <li>Testing guidance and tips for isolating and identifying a particular compatibility problem.</li>
  <li>Tools for development and testing.</li>
  <li>Links to resources, technical articles and helpful blog posts.</li>
  <li>Various methods for providing feedback to Microsoft.</li>
  </ol>

  Cool stuff, in any case. I look forward to seeing IE 7 reach RTM, and to the continuing efforts of the IE team. It's good to see that they're back and firing on all cylinders :-)
