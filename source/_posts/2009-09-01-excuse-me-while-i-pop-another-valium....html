<blockquote>"Engineering is the art of modelling materials we do not wholly understand, into shapes we cannot precisely analyze so as to withstand forces we cannot properly assess, in such a way that the public has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance."</blockquote>

- Dr AR Dykes, British Institution of Structural Engineers, 1976.
