I believe I was just able to get rid of the last truly serious bug in repeating alarms. I'm sure there will be a few I missed, but that's what a beta test is for!

  iRooster 1.2 is coming along quite swimmingly, if I do say so myself. I have implemented repeating alarms, made a couple very nice modifications to the UI in general, and I am hard at work on the last few features I have planned for this release.

  More information will be forthcoming in the not-too-distant future. I have a vacation coming up from Sept 1 - Sept 8, and I will definitely bring my iBook with me to nail down this release. I'm just going back to Minnesota, so it's not like I'll be skipping the surf and sand or anything to get this done :-).
