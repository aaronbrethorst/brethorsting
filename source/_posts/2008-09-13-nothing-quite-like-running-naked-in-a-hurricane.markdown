I've been watching coverage of Hurricane Ike's landfall in Texas all evening, and was just watching another clip on the Weather Channel's website. I noticed something in the last second of this video that's worth watching: <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid823425597/bclid877032950/bctid1592089261">some guy runs naked across the background just before the clip ends</a>. Not my ideal way to gain notoriety, but to each their own.
