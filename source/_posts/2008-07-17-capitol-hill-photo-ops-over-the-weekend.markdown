The Seattle Asian Art Museum is hosting a 75th anniversary party on Sunday, July 19th, from 10am to 4pm. Sounds like there should be some good photo ops with a youth marimba ensemble, Chinese lion dancing, juggling and more. I'll certainly be there at some point, and a dozen or so pictures should appear on Flickr shortly thereafter.
