I have one rather big issue with Mac OS X that I hope is resolved in the not-too-distant future. Removing nasty, buggy kernel extensions (kexts) is a terribly difficult process most of the time. Mind you, well-behaved kext authors do <i>nice things</i> like include uninstallers, but god forbid that every author of a device driver would do this. I have experienced periodic, nasty issues with kernel panics on my system with a particularly ugly, generic compact flash card reader in the past, and I was reminded of it when I came across <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/08/microtechs_crashtacular_zio_driver.html">a blog entry on daring fireball</a>. It would be absolutely wonderful if we could expect every kext author to include an uninstaller, but rather unrealistic. I get the feeling that most companies writing software at that level tend to be PC-centric, and that they stick some poor schmoe in charge of that sort of thing (Microsoft Mice: I am looking in your direction with that hideous Mac OS X "Control Panel", Microsoft Windows Media Player 7 for Mac OS X: I am also looking in your direction!).

I have to play Microsoft apologist here for two seconds and remind everyone that the Mac Business Unit at Microsoft is <i>not</i> in charge of Windows Media Player for OS X, nor the Intellimouse Control Panel. They do Office, Remote Desktop, Messenger, Virtual PC, and whatever else I happen to be forgetting here.

Random story from WWDC 2003: I was sitting in some session (I think it was Advanced Cocoa UI Techniques) and saw a guy with a WWDC badge that said "Microsoft Corporation" under the company. However, I didn't recognize him. Upon closer inspection of his badge I realized that he had penciled in "formerly of Connectix" underneath the MSFT declaration.
