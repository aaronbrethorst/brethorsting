I'm heading off to Vegas for the weekend on October 7th. I've never had the pleasure of visiting, so it should be an interesting time if nothing else. Good change of pace to be certain.

  Mr. Rob Fierst was also kind enough to give me an incredible deal today on a leather sofa and loveseat, which I will take receipt of tomorrow evening. I'll finally be able to retire the $50 couch I've had for the past year.
