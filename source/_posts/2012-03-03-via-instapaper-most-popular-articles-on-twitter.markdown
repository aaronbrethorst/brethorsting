A couple weeks back, I noticed that when you 'like' an article in Instapaper, it will publish a link to it on your Twitter account with a predictable suffix, assuming of course that you have enabled Twitter integration. The most interesting part of this for me was the predictable suffix thing. Namely, it's really easy to run a search on Twitter to specifically pull out all of the articles that people have liked "(via Instapaper)". With that bit of knowledge, I was able to build a working prototype of what would become my new site, <a href="http://www.viainstapaper.com">(via Instapaper)</a>.

In short, (via Instapaper) helps you find the <a href="http://www.viainstapaper.com">most popular articles</a> (or liked) from Instapaper, as seen on Twitter. The site has, given the amount of time I've spent on it, become a reasonable success. I've gotten mentioned by Marco Arment's official Twitter account, received props from the creators of Longform and Give Me Something to Read, and am followed by a number of highly regarded journalists. All in all, not too shabby for a weekend project.
