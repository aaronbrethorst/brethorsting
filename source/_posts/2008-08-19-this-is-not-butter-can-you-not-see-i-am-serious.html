The creators of I Can Has Cheezburger just launched a new Engrish pictures website called <a href="http://engrishfunny.com/">EngrishFunny</a>. They have one picture up of a Japanese coffee vending machine (selling something called <a href="http://engrishfunny.com/2008/08/13/engrish-a-steaming-hot-cup-on-a-cold-emo-morning/">Deepresso</a>), which made me feel nostalgic for the vacation I took to Tokyo and Kyoto this sprint. Man, I want to go back there.
