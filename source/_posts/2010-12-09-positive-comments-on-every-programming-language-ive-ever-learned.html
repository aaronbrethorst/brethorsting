<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li>C - So raw, so powerful, so easy to shoot yourself in foot.</li>
	<li>Scheme - It may have taken me a month and a half to grok Scheme, but the moment that I finally did, angels sang and the heavens opened up to me.</li>
	<li>Java - My introduction to OOP could have been significantly more painful had it been conducted in C++.</li>
	<li>Objective C - It's enabled me to create many lovely apps for two different platforms, and is also responsible for the bulk of my income today.</li>
	<li>VDM-SL - A fantastically bizarre modeling language with built-in pre and post-conditions. The Professor from whom I learned this language was also responsible for instilling a deep fear of Airbus planes in me for a long time (as it works out, he was on Boeing's dole), and also for imprinting this idiom deep into my brain:Â if (0 == someFunctionCall) { /* Apparently people call these "<a href="http://wiert.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/yoda-conditions-from-stackoverflow-new-programming-jargon-you-coined/">Yoda Conditions</a>" */ }</li>
	<li>Tcl - Uhh, I managed to survive the assignments that required me to use it in college. I found Tk to be a rather novel UI toolkit.</li>
	<li>Ruby - Beautiful, terse, and phenomenally expressive.</li>
	<li>Javascript - What was once one of my least favorite programming languages has become one of my most favorite...as long as I have handy abstractions bolted on top, at least.</li>
	<li>C# - It's like Java, but without the suck. And the IDE...Oh, the IDE.</li>
	<li>VB.NET - I guess that "My" namespace thing is cool.</li>
	<li>PHP - In all seriousness, PHP is a bloated, ugly inconsistent, icky language, but it's incredibly easy to use, and the only way to interact with Wordpress.</li>
</ul>
