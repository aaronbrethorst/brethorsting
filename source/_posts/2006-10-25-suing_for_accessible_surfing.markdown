  <blockquote>Last month a federal judge in California allowed the [National Federation for the Blind's] case [suing Target Corp. for an accessible web site] to proceed, rejecting Target's argument that its Web site wasn't subject to the Americans With Disabilities Act, a 1990 law that requires retailers and other public places to make accommodations for people with disabilities. Target argued that the law only covered physical spaces.</blockquote>

  This is a <em>big</em> deal.
