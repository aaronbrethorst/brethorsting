<em>How did you travel in 2010? How and/or where would you like to travel next year?</em>

Well, I took three trips this year: Minneapolis for a full month in July, Boston and Washington DC in October, and Maui right now. Planes were the way to go each time, of course.

I'd love to spend another month in Minneapolis next summer. It was a good way to see family and friends without feeling pressured on time. Beyond that, I'd love to go back to Japan or see Spain for the first time.
