<blockquote>“Abu Ghraib was a huge disappointment,” Mr. Bush said, referring to the detainee abuse scandal in Iraq that proved deeply damaging to the American image there and around the world. “Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment.”</blockquote>
Funny, I'm really disappointed in the expenditure of billions of dollars, thousands of American lives lost, countless Iraqi lives lost, loss of American standing around the world, and who knows what else. A significant disappointment, indeed.
