I was at the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157605889225699/">2008 Gay Pride Parade in Downtown Seattle this afternoon</a>, and took about 600 pictures in total. I've posted 35 of the ones I saved, and still have a few more to put up as soon as I figure out how Flickr's parental control thingies work (they're all of naked bikers and rollerbladers, see). Still, there were many good pictures to be had, including the following:
