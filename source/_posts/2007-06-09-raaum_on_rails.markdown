Alright, so I'll readily admit this has nothing to do with UI Design. Nevertheless, if you're trying to slog your way through the Ruby on Rails <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">API documentation</a> or official <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails">wiki</a> you may be much better served checking on <a href="http://rails.raaum.org/index.html">Ryan Raaum's excellent primer on Rails first.</a>

  Raaum's Rails Reader has several advantages over the other two resources mentioned: one, it's much easier to find your way around than in the API docs. Two, it actually recommends best practices (check out the ActiveRecord content, for instance, which I find invaluable). Three, it tends to not be <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/LoginGenerator/versions/296">self-contradictory</a>, which is always useful when you're just getting up to speed on a new technology.
