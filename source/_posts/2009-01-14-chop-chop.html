Day 13 of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157612028658986/">365 and counting</a>...

I was excited to find out, just now, that yesterday's photo was deemed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/2009/01/13/page3/">the 28th most interesting photo uploaded to Flickr yesterday</a> by some anonymous piece of software. Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. (Real sarcasm is actually much lower than apparent sarcasm, incidentally. I really am excited by this).
