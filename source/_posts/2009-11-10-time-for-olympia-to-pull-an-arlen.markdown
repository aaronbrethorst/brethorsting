I mean, don't get me wrong, <a href="http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/10/14/o/">Arlen is completely screwed in 2010</a>, but that shouldn't make Olympia Snowe think for a second that switching parties is a bad idea. Cuz, let's face facts: <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/11/10/802931/-Poll:-Snowe-would-lose-GOP-primary-to-generic-conservative">she's going down in 2012's Republican Senatorial Primary in Maine if she doesn't switch to the big D</a>. She might as well do it now when it's possible for her to have a real impact on health care reform and thereby impress some of her new primary voters instead of trying to have her cake and eat it too, which will just leave her getting Arlen'd.
