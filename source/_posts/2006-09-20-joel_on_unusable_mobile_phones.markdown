<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/19b.html">Joel Spolsky rips into Sprint's new LG Fusic phone</a>:
  <blockquote>All the "tipping point" theories in the world wonâ€™t protect Sprint from the basic truth that the LG Fusic user interface could basically serve as an almost complete textbook for a semester-long course in user interface design, teaching students of usability exactly what NOT to do.</blockquote>

  I've always been a little (ok, a lot) skeptical about the value of convergence in the mobile device space. It sounds great in principal, especially considering that I carry a DS Lite, iPod 15GB, and a T-Mobile MDA with me everywhere. Of course, in practicality, I've never been quite satisfied with the music or games experience on my phone, and I'll be damned if I ever try <a href="http://www.sidetalkin.com/">sidetalking</a> into my DS.
