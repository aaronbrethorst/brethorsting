Why on earth doesn't Apple dedicate a person for a month to documenting the facilities built into XCode for creating new editor types? Jeez, this really irritates me to no end.

  There is <i>tons</i> of documentation surrounding this for Visual Studio. Admittedly, it is challenging to learn how the entire VS integration process works, but you can do virtually anything once you figure it out.

  All I really want is a graphical editor for my Movable Type blog templates. Is that really so much to ask?

  Actually, if the documentation on all of the funky little macros used by MT internally was more readily findable for me, I could probably kludge together a program in a couple of hours to do this for myself.

  I just don't have the time right now, but I'd certainly pay $15 or $20 if someone developed this as shareware. Any takers out there?
