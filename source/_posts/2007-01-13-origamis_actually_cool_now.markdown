Remember Origami, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/03/09/was-origami-overhyped/">the overhyped ultra-mobile pc</a>? It was supposed to retail for super-cheap, and be a fantastic extension of your existing in-home PC infrastructure. Unfortunately, the devices ended up retailing for about a thousand bucks instead. I've always loved these things, still, and am quite interested in buying one at some point. I think they're awesome. And finally, it looks like Origami has come into its own. jkOnTheRun has <a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/7441737">kind words for the Vista Origami experience</a>, and thinks that this thing may be a killer:
  <blockquote>So far, the Origami team has knocked my socks off with the demo I saw; I just might have to give up and say "we've got a winner here!" It's obvious that the team has listened to user feedback and matured the new Origami Experience far beyond the original Touch Pack.</blockquote>
