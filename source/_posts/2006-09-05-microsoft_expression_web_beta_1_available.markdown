Microsoft just released Beta 1 of their new, designer-oriented web development product, Expression Web. Expression Web, which requires v2.0 of the .NET Framework, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/web_designer/wd_free_trial.aspx">can be downloaded for free from Microsoft</a> (requires free registration and a Windows Live ID).

  As the marketing copy states,
  <blockquote>Expression Web is a professional design tool that helps you create and work with:
  - Standards-based Web sites
  - Sophisticated CSS-based layouts
  - Extensive CSS formatting and management
  - Rich data presentation
  - Powerful ASP.NET 2.0-based technology</blockquote>

  The Beta works with Windows XP SP2, Windows 2003, and Windows Vista, and is all that, plus a bag of chips. I'm installing it now and will report back with my thoughts before too long.
