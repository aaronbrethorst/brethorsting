I am hard at work on iRooster 1.2. I don't have a firm release date for it yet, but I am happy with the progress I am making on repeating alarms, and I feel that the UI is roughly where I want it to be.

  Other niceties that I'm adding in for the next version include full 24-hour clock support. I know that this has been a widely requested feature among the increasingly large percentage of my users who aren't from the US, and I totally respect your preference for this type of clock display. So, suffice it to say, it's finally coming, and it'll be done well.

  I should have auto-unmuting support built in as well for the next version, but I haven't had a chance to really investigate exactly how to do this yet. There will probably be a few other additions made that I haven't disclosed yet, but I need to see how quickly I nail down the features I've already described here.
