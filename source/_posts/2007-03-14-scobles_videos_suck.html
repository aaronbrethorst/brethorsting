Or so I hear. I've never actually taken the time to watch one, <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/12/a_few_predictions_for_the_new_year.html">as I'm absolutely opposed to his employer's name on grounds of taste</a>.

   Also, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/03/14/the-hype-about-that-micro-blogging-service/">I'm happy to hear that Maryam has banned Robert from discussing Twitter</a>. This is a relief. I had gotten into the habit of shift-deleting Scoble posts after a couple weeks of his unending discussion of Twitter. (yo, Robert: there's a keyboard shortcut I bet you forgot about!)
