I've been lusting after the Media Center PCs that are out there for a while now. I've been planning on just building one for a while, but devices like this new <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/4970876118818521/">Sony Media Center Edition machine</a> just make me weak in the knees.

  This is also further proof that Sony's varied and sundry business units don't just not talk, but seem to actively hate each other (see PSX, aka the worst way to spend $1000, and the memory stick).
