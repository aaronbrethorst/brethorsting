One thing I've got to give Sony is that they almost always know their stuff when it comes to innovative hardware design. Sure, the occasional high ticket item may look more like a George Foreman grill than the harbinger of high definition gaming, but who wouldn't want to enjoy a tasty, low-fat steak while saving the world with Solid Snake?

  I just ran across a video of a new music device, called <a href="http://www.sony.jp/products/Consumer/rolly/products/IntroMovie.html">Sony Rolly</a>, which looks pretty cool. No clue if this is something they're actually selling or if it's just a prototype. Either way, it's definitely Japanese. As someone far more amusing than me said recently, <em>"Ultra future wave Sony Rolly for beautiful human life! Non Stop Golden Dance Hour, Feel the beat!"<span></span></em>
