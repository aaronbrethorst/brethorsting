<a href="http://www.reason.com/0502/fe.mg.neal.shtml">Mike Godwin (best known from the EFF) with Neal Stephenson</a>: <em>It has been the case for quite a while that the cultural left distrusted geeks and their works; the depiction of technical sorts in popular culture has been overwhelmingly negative for at least a generation now. More recently, the cultural right has apparently decided that it doesnâ€™t care for some of what scientists have to say. So the technical class is caught in a pincer between these two wings of the so-called culture war.</em>
