<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr9sy37GIRc">I just found this on YouTube</a>: it's a video of a new feature with unintended consequences in the video game, MLB 2k6. Basically, a player can jump up to the top of a stadium wall to catch a ball that would otherwise be a home run. Unfortunately, this also seems to apply to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Monster">37' Green Monster of Fenway</a>.
