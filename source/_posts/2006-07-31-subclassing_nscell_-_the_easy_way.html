<a href="http://www.mikeash.com/">Mike Ash</a>, a developer at <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/">Rogue Amoeba</a>, published an article a while back about subclassing the Cocoa class NSCell in a way that doesn't make you want to stab your eyeballs with a pen. Having suffered through a lot of this with iRooster, I recognize and appreciate the value present in this article, and I hope it helps save an extra eyeball or two.

  <em>Anyone who's done enough Cocoa has eventually run into the nightmare that is subclassing an NSCell. While it looks simple enough, actually getting an Interface Builder-generated control to use your NSCell subclass is effectively impossible. You either have to use CustomViews in IB, write an IBPalette, or do a whole lot of tedious and error-prone manual copying of attributes to get everything from the IB-provided cell into your own.

  Tonight I'm going to show you a simple class you can add to your project which will make everything Just Work. </em>
