<a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2006/11/08/windows-vista-releases-to-manufacturing.aspx">Windows Vista's finally out the door</a>, and with it comes a whole bevy of new stuff, like .NET FX 3.0 (with WPF/Avalon). I've spent the past year working on nothing but ensuring that Visual Studio works beautifully with Vista, and it's great to see Vista finally making it out the door. I'm just finishing up an installation of Vista RTM on my laptop right now. Can't wait!
