I have been having a constant low-grade panic attack over Monday since I got the fateful call on Thursday. It's getting to be a little overwhelming. Every time I think I have been able to just deal with what's happening I remember the gravity of the situation with Company X and my heart starts flopping around like a bunny in a ziploc bag (a phrase shamelessly taken from Neal Stephenson).

  So, on the plus side of things I find out what's happening in about 38 hours from now. This is just far too long for me. I don't think I have ever wanted a <i>Monday</i> to come this much ever. Oh well. There's really nothing I can about it for now, so I guess I just need to cope.

  My sister moved back to Minneapolis from Boston yesterday; I spent some time with her today. It's nice to actually get to spend time with family in a relaxed setting every now and then. I forget occasionally how much I really do like my siblings.

  I received a UPS tracking number for beep, my 700MHz iBook, today. It should arrive on Tuesday, <i>not</i> Monday. This irritates me slightly, but I feel that this young padawan needs to learn more in the realm of patience on such immutable factors in life.

  Music in heavy rotation on my iPod right now:
  Wilco - Yankee Hotel Foxtrot
  Portishead - Dummy
  Radiohead - OK Computer and Hail to the Thief
