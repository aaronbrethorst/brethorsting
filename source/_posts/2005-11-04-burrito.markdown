Fuck, I want a burrito right now. H.U.N.G.R.Y. B.U.R.R.I.T.O. I think I'm going to go buy one. The advantages of living across the street from a 24 hour QFC that carries organic bean and cheese burritos are many. The disadvantages inherent to the situation, though, are that I have to fend off hobos to get there. C'est la vie.
