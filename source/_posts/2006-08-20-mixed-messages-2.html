I'm hanging out in my apartment shirtless. I'm going to play Dead Rising on my Xbox 360 and 32" HDTV. While drinking red wine. I'm not sure what sort of message this sends, but I wanted to share it nonetheless.

  In other news, it's my homedog <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=980">Owen</a>'s birthday today. In other other news, I'll be out of the salt mines and in Mpls for a week starting September 10th. I hope to see you (the three of you who read this blog, that is).
