Hey guess what!? In my copious amounts of spare time (aka nights and weekends), I put together a new iPhone application called Fair on a Stick. <a href="http://faironastick.com/">It's an interactive iPhone guide to the 2010 Minnesota State Fair</a>, and—best of all—it'll be totally free.

I just finished the app and accompanying website tonight, so it hasn't had a chance to make it through Apple's review process yet, but you can expect it to be live in about a week, give or take.

Check out the site and add your email address to the list to be notified the second the app goes live, or just search the App Store when you end up at the Fair.
