I've been laying low for the past month, and my posting was sporadic even before that. Part of the reason for that was the Christmas-New Years blogging deadzone. But the bulk of the reason was I changed jobs. It's pretty common for Microsofties to switch jobs. I've heard numbers saying that most people move around after about a year and a half or two years. In any case, I was in my old team for quite a bit longer than that.

  For the past three years and change, I was the Ux Program Manager for Visual Studio, and the PM for the team that built the Visual Studio shell (devenv.exe). I started on November 10, 2003 and left on January 26, 2007. Not a bad run. I feel like I accomplished a great deal during that time: Visual Studio 2005 won Infoworld's award for Best IDE in 2005 due to the product's usability and fit-and-finish; Visual Studio 2005 is reasonably well supported on Windows Vista; Orcas is off to a fantastic start, and will be a product that serves to delight and enthuse every single one of Visual Studio's customers. And, at the end of it all, I felt like I was ready for a change.

  I've joined a fantastic, new, and very small team run by the super-talented <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/johnmont/">John Montgomery</a>. I can't say much of anything about what we're doing right now, but I will as soon as I can.
