The Toyota Prius has a really handy in-dash display that gives you all sorts of information, like the current radio station, GPS maps, and so forth. It also displays messages to you under some circumstances, like the following one that I observed earlier today:
  <blockquote>Message:
  For safety, no message given while driving.</blockquote>

  (seriously)
