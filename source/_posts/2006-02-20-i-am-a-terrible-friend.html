It took me over a month to figure out that a friend of mine (who I dated briefly last year) has been pissed at me enough for five weeks now to not be willing to speak to me anymore. Yeah, I'm a fuckhead. Yeah, I've been way too busy for my own health or sanity. Yeah, it's only going to get worse over the next month.

  Oh yeah, here was a fun one-sided text message conversation I was lucky enough to receive last weekend:

  (1:01 AM) 954-xxxx: Hey
  (1:04 AM) 954-xxxx: Itsok if you hate me...

  Sigh, I do so love drunken people who refuse to exit my life.
