<a href="http://www.reverb10.com/december-25-photo/">December 25 – Photo – a present to yourself</a>. <em>Sift through all the photos of you from the past year. Choose one that best captures you; either who you are, or who you strive to be. Find the shot of you that is worth a thousand words. Share the image, who shot it, where, and what it best reveals about you.</em>

Normally, I'm on the other side of the camera.
