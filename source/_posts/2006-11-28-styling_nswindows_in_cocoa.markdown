<a href="http://bithaus.com/2006/11/04/styledwindow/">Bithaus</a> has a handy little chunk of Objective C source code up that provides programmatic capabilities to styling NSWindows. It's modeled on Matt Gemmell's snazzy <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/source/">TunesWindow</a> class (which I use in <a href="http://chimpsoftware.com">iRooster</a>, by the by), but appears to handle all of its window style in code instead of by loading and stretching PNGs, as TunesWindow does. Very cool, very handy.

  I imagine that I will incorporate this into iRooster before too long. It'll be nice to get rid of the few little PNG files that I have sitting around to draw window backgrounds, and also I should be able to provide some sort of power user feature for customizing the window background. I've always enjoyed providing fun, little undocumented features like that in my app.
