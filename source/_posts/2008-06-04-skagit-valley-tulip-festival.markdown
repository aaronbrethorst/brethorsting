At the end of April, I drove up to Mount Vernon in Skagit Valley, up in northern Washington, for the 2008 Skagit Valley Tulip Festival. I've been a bit slow in posting pictures, but I finally got around to it tonight. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157605445669905/">Nine photos from Skagit Valley made the cut</a>. Here are a couple of my favorites.
