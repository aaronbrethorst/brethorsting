In the interest of clearing up any confusion you may have over the game consoles Sony has released, or plans to release, just refer to this handy listing.

  Playstation - A small gray CD-based video game console.

  PSX - It depends on who you're asking. Either the same thing as was listed above, or a hulking $900 PVR/DVD/game console.

  PS1 - Contrary to popular belief, this is not identical to the Playstation. This is a wacky, cheap, tiny, white console that replaced the Playstation or PSX.

  Playstation 2 or PS2 - Sony's current game console. Supposedly was going to have enough computing power to display photorealistic 3D images rendered on the fly. The truth fell quite short. Still lacks triggers. Really cool at first, and now just an adornment next to my TV.

  Playstation 3 or PS3 - Sony's next-generation game console. Supposedly will have enough computing power to display photorealistic 3D images rendered on the fly. It will also supposedly make use of grid computing, or some such. The jury's still out, but I expect to be underwhelmed. Again.

  PSP or Playstation Portable - Sony's next-generation portable game console. Supposedly will have graphics on par with Playstation 2. All I know is that the first Final Fantasy-branded title for this platform will be a movie, and the first Metal Gear title will be a fucking <i>card game</i>. I am severely underwhelmed at the moment.

  Confused yet? :-)
