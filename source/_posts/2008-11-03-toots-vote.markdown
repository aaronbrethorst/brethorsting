This made me tear up. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/11/3/22506/7980/175/651740">I just read this over at DKos</a> that Barack Obama's grandmother's vote will be counted under Hawaii state law.
<blockquote>Ms. Dunham’s absentee mail ballot was received and reviewed under the Hawaii standards for processing absentee mail ballots... She was alive at that time. Her ballot will be opened tomorrow, and it will be counted in the same way that all absentee voters would be treated under our law.</blockquote>
