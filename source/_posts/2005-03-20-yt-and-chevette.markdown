I just found a fascinating personal account of being a bike messenger over on <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/3/19/133129/548">Kuro5hin</a>. Well worth the read. It's also good to know that there are certain things that would be undeniably cool to do, but for which I will never have the chops.
