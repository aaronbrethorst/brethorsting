<a href="http://www.slashdot.org">In some circles</a>, it's taken as a basic truth that <a href="http://www.google.com">certain</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com">companies</a> <a href="http://www.37signals.com">have</a> <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">more</a> <a href="http://www.ibm.com">innovativeness</a> <a href="http://www.redhat.com">in</a> <a href="http://www.sun.com">their</a> <a href="http://www.novell.com">pinkies</a> than <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">other companies can muster among all of their 70,000 employees</a>. I am firmly of the belief that this narrow perspective is flawed, at best.

  In reality, all of the companies I linked to above-whether it's Apple with the Mac or iPod, 37 Signals with Ruby on Rails, Nintendo with the DS and Wii, IBM with Eclipse and a bajillion other things, Red Hat, Sun, Novell, and Microsoft-are very innovative companies that have done a great deal to push the state of the art forward. The question of "what is innovation?" has been kicking around in my mind quite a bit this week due to a few factors.

  First, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/09/switched-on-time-machine-restores-best-not-first/">an Engadget article</a> published on Wednesday talks about how Apple's big announcements for Leopard really aren't anything new, but still offer up functionality I consider to be innovative in terms of ease of use, and real customer focus:
  <blockquote>[A] decade before Spotlight shone in Tiger, utilities such as On Locaiton (sic) provided classic Mac OS lightning-fast index-based searches. And Konfabulator, now owned by Yahoo, inspired Dashboard.</blockquote>

  Second, Scott Berkun, author of the Art of Project Management, has been blogging quite a bit lately on the topic, and <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/?p=376">soliciting the opinions of others on what innovation means to them</a>. <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/?p=364">Scott also shares an amusing anecdote</a> on the first numbered patent granted in the United States:
  <blockquote>U.S. Patent #1 was granted to Senator John Ruggle of Maine...The invention? Comically enough, a reinvention of the wheel. Ruggle designed a new train wheel that yielded more traction and prevented sliding.</blockquote>

  So, what do I think innovation really means? I'll try to answer that tomorrow.
