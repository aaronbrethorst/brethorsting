I had dinner at <a href="http://www.mattsinthemarket.com/">Matt's in the Market</a> last week. As always, the food was fantastic, and the ambiance wasn't far behind. Their bread pudding and scallops are absolutely to die for, and I ate so much that I thought I might (hah!). <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157605384888330/">A little more is available on Flickr</a>.
