<a href="http://www.hahakid.net/forallseasons/forallseasons.html">Andreas Mueller created a series of interactive vignettes entitled For All Seasons back in 2004</a>. It's quite difficult to explain, so I'll leave it to him:
  <blockquote>[For All Seasons is a] piece about memories, seasons and using the elements of the textual representation of the memory to create an interactive one.</blockquote>

  It's beautiful, sleek and truly innovative. Do make sure you read the ReadMe before trying out the application, though.
