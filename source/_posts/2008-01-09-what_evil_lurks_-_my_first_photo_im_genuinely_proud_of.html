I took a photo of part of the Seattle skyline last Saturday night that I am incredibly proud of. I know there are a number of improvements I can make to subsequent reshoots, and I hope to do so if there weather permits this weekend. It's posted on Flickr, and you can view a thumbnail of it down below. Feel free to visit Flickr for the full-sized original, available under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license.
