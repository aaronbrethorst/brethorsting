I am very happy to announce that I have finally released iRooster 2.0, the best damned alarm clock for Mac OS X. I am extremely excited to finally make this broadly available. I feel like it's taken me practically forever to get this out the door, but it is a terrific improvement over previous versions, and well worth the necessary time.
