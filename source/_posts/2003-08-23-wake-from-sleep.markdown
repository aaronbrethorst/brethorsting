Well, it looks like Wake from Sleep is finally working properly, at least under most best-to-good-case scenarios. I am not entirely sure how much abuse it can take quite yet, so I need to keep plugging away at that.

On the bright side of things, though, Jaguar users can definitely rejoice: wake from sleep will work under 10.2.
