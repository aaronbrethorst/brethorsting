There's a bit of a hullabaloo going on out there in the blogosphere about Edelman mailing out free Ferarri laptops with Windows Vista to bloggers. Scoble thinks it's <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/12/27/i-think-the-microsoft-vista-giveaway-is-an-awesome-idea/">an awesome idea</a>, and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/28.html">Joel Spolsky thinks Scoble's completely wrong</a> on the basis that this laptop giveaway constitutes an unethical arrangement, and that it is destroying the nascent credibility of blogs everywhere:
  <blockquote>This is the most frustrating thing about the practice of giving bloggers free stuff: it pisses in the well, reducing the credibility of all blogs. I'm upset that people trust me less because of the behavior of other bloggers.</blockquote>

  Whatever is right or wrong in this case, Joel stated something after this that rankled me beyond belief:
  <blockquote>Joel on Software is really a non-profit, advertising-free site</blockquote>

  Meanwhile, right next to this is a HUGE friggin block informing you that you can find cool jobs on the Joel job board, or post them for only a few hundred bucks.

  You can also try out FogBugz, a product made by Fog Creek Software, of which Joel is CEO.

  Or, you can even play around with Copilot, which costs ten bucks a day. Or buy the associated DVD. Or buy Joel's two books.

  Do you see the hypocrisy? I don't mind that Joel pimps the hell out of Fog Creek on his blog. In fact, I expect it. It's the best advertising Fog Creek could possibly get, and all it really costs is hosting fees (paid for by Fog Creek?) and Joel's time. I only wish Joel would remove this one statement from his post. He is not running some little rinky-dink blog as a labor of love; it is a seriously valuable piece of advertising that also appears to be a labor of love.
