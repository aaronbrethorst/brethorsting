Immediate reactions after first firing up iTunes 8, and configuring the Genius feature:
<ul>
	<li>Wow, I didn't think Apple could make iTunes look more inconsistent with the rest of the OS and itself than they already had. Guess they topped my expectations.</li>
	<li>Genius is cool, but why can't I resize it?</li>
	<li>Genius shows me some stuff I already have.</li>
	<li>Why doesn't Genius let me say "yes, I like this album," or "no, I hate this album?"</li>
	<li>I can't get rid of the little arrow links to the iTunes Store in the tabular view anymore. Very unfortunate.</li>
	<li>iTunes still uses song artist instead of album artist for sorting tracks. You'd think that no one at Apple ever listens to any rap or hip-hop (or any music where the album contains more than one artist). It shouldn't take me several clicks to listen to all of <em>Stankonia</em> or Thievery Corporation's <em>The Cosmic Game</em>.</li>
</ul>
<div>Overall rating: eh, it's fine.</div>
