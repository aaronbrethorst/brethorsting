GridSkipper introduced a new service with the beginning of 24 Day 5 last month, the <a href="http://www.gridskipper.com/travel/jacktracker/index.php">Jacktracker</a>.

  The Jacktracker features:
  Insightful commentary (<em>"Jack is dead. No he’s not. Frank Flynn = Jack Bauer. Frank drills oil, as well as Diane Huxley."</em>),

  Useful data points (<em>Hard Perimeters in Place: 0; Hard Perimeter Breaches: 1; Terrorist Attacks: 1; 24 Time/Distance Reality Breaches: 2</em>),

  Blow-by-blow accounts of who died,

  and annotated Google Maps-powered depictions of Jack's many travels around L.A. County (<em>"Jack Bauer: CTU to Hidden Valley, California, via Spaceship Enterprise: 47 miles over 10 Minutes = 282 mph. Give us a break…"</em>)
