Sasha and Malia Obama started attending <a href="http://www.sidwell.edu/">Sidwell Friends School</a>, a private Quaker K-12 school, today. In case you're looking for more on Sidwell Friends, here's some information I put together on the institution.
<ul>
	<li>It's located about four-and-a-half miles from the White House, a 12 minute drive. [<a href="http://www.google.com/maps?saddr=White+House,+Washington,+DC+20006&amp;geocode=CdVuWcmUj1P8FV6MUQId7oNo-w&amp;dirflg=&amp;daddr=3825+Wisconsin+Avenue+NW+20016&amp;f=d&amp;sll=38.898782,-77.036562&amp;sspn=0.011038,0.022659&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.920622,-77.04669&amp;spn=0.04414,0.090637&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">Google Maps</a>]</li>
	<li>It was started 126 years ago, in 1883. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidwell_Friends_School">Wikipedia</a>]</li>
	<li>Previous attendees have included the children of Teddy Roosevelt, Richard Nixon (who was, himself, a Quaker), Bill Clinton, and Al Gore. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidwell_Friends_School">Wikipedia</a>]</li>
	<li>It currently enrolls 1,091 students, with 35 more boys than girls. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidwell_Friends_School">Wikipedia</a>]</li>
	<li>Annual tuition is $28,442 for elementary students, and $29,442 for middle and high school students, plus some additional fees. [<a href="http://www.sidwell.edu/admissions/tuition.asp">Sidwell Friends</a>]</li>
	<li>The menu beats the crap out of the Sysco-provided lunches I received while I was in school: cheese tortellini and garlic green beans, with a clementine to top it off, anyone? [<a href="http://www.sidwell.edu/students/index.asp?lunchStartDate=1/5/2009">Sidwell Friends</a>]</li>
