I picked up a Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens yesterday, and it is absolutely fantastic! This is really a gorgeous lens: very fast, very sharp, super high quality, and it weighs just over 2 pounds. Simply crazy.

and then ended up on Helen's condo building roof where I took pictures of a very unusual event for Seattle: a thunderstorm.

I'm looking forward to fireworks tomorrow night, and hope to spend a lot more time with this lens over the next few days.
