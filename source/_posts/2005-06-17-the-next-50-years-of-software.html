I was pointed at this by Larry Osterman's weblog today. It's a paper written by Nathan Myhrvold (former CTO of Microsoft) for the ACM97 conference entitled <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/acm97/nm/sld001.htm">The Next 50 Years of Software</a>. It does a lot to explain software bloat, the changing role of the PC in everyday life, blah blah blah. You know, the typical stuff I love reading ;-).
