In your face, Nikon users! Obama's portrait was shot with the Canon 5D Mark II, with what looks like the 24-105L kit lens (although 'kit' seems like such a dirty word for a beautiful lens like that).Â 

It seems that Pete Souza, the official White House photographer, used two strobes in the portrait. There is one at camera left with a shoot-through umbrella, and another at camera-right, which looks like a...softbox? Tragically, I'm not nearly the strobist that <a href="http://www.strobist.com">David Hobby</a> is, so I can't say definitively.

A few more factoids:
<ul>
	<li>Pete's a Mac user</li>
	<li>Pete, just like the rest of the world, is still using Photoshop CS3</li>
	<li>There's a little bit of lint on Barack's suit: underneath the American flag pin, and then some more on the other suit lapel</li>
	<li>This is the first time the official Presidential portrait has been shot with a digital camera</li>
</ul>
