<a href="http://www.applegazette.com/mac/rumor-aqua-to-be-replaced-with-illuminous/">Apple Gazette</a>, a heretofore unknown Mac rumors site, claims that Apple will replace Aqua with a new look-and-feel codenamed <em>Illuminous</em> in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, scheduled for release sometime in 2007.

The conjecture states that:
<blockquote>What will Illuminous look like? That’s anybody’s guess at this point, but we might be seeing some hints of what Illuminous holds in the recent release of iTunes.</blockquote>

God, I hope this proves to be false. iTunes 7 is the ugliest piece of software Apple has released in a very long time. To be perfectly honest, I think that Panther (excluding the creepy brushed-metal Finder) was really the pinnacle of OS X's User Experience. I guess the only place to go after that is down. I really hope this is false. I don't want to make <a href="http://chimpsoftware.com">iRooster</a> look like iTunes 7.
