I took my car into the shop today to get it fixed. Finally. I get rear-ended a month ago and I finally find the time to fix my damned car. Anyway, I got a friggin' Volvo S60 from the rental car place out of the deal. I'm going to only have to pay something like $12 / day for it too. Not bad at all.

  I don't think I'll be buying one of those anytime soon (it feels like a "I just turned 40" car), but it is <i>really</i> nice. I'm still looking at the Volvo S40 among other things.
