The Coding Monkeys (aka Martin, Martin, und Dominik) just released <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit 2.0</a>. SubEthaEdit is a snazzy text editor for Mac OS X that supports collaborative text editing over Apple's zeroconfig networking protocol (Rendezvous).

  2.0 seems like it has some very cool new features (like autocompletion). I'm going to have to snag a copy and kick the tires when I get home this evening.

  Congrats guys!
