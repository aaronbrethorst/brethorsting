<em>update: i've received five requests</em>

  I'm going to give away invitations to <a href="http://www.popfly.com/">Popfly</a> to the first five people who email me or leave comments telling me what they want to do with the service.

  Seriously, it's that easy: just leave me a note saying that you want to build a mashup that does 'x' and I'll send you an invite.

  If you haven't seen Popfly yet, it's a new service from my team in Microsoft that lets you easily build rich, visually-compelling mashups by combining information from different sites like Netflix, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/technology/25social.html">Facebook</a>, Xbox Live, Virtual Earth, and tons of others without writing any code.
