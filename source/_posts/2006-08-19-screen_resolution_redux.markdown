Last Tuesday, I wrote about <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/08/picking_a_screen_resolution.html">Jakob Nielsen's latest thoughts on screen resolution and web browsing</a>. His conclusion was that you should optimize for 1024x768px, but ensure that the site is still usable at 800x600px. I also posted a breakdown of the top screen resolutions for visitors to this site. At the time, 1600x1200px was most-used (which is way outside of the norm), but since then I've seen a ton of traffic come in through <a href="http://www.scobleizer.com">Robert Scoble</a>, which has resulted in some very interesting changes in my data.

  I wanted to give you a sense of the change in this data that I've seen since August 15th. The following percentages constitute 72 hours worth of traffic after Scoble linked over to my comment on him still being cool, despite being a shark-jumper ;-).

  Scoble's readers are closer to the screen resolution data described by Nielsen, but the data is still wildly different from your average computer user.

  <table>
  <tr><th>Screen Resolution</th><th>Percentage</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1024x768</td><td>34.34%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1280x1024</td><td>24.24%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1600x1200</td><td>9.60%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1280x800</td><td>8.08%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1400x1050</td><td>6.06%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1920x1200</td><td>3.54%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1680x1050</td><td>3.03%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1440x900</td><td>2.53%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1280x768</td><td>1.52%</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1152x864</td><td>1.52%</td></tr>
  </table>

  Guess how many people with 800x600px resolutions ended up on my site over the past three days? Two! Not a high-priority scenario, to say the least.
