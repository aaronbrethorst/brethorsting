WWDC might be catching most of the news right now, but Microsoft has its own developer event going on now too. TechEd Europe in Amsterdam just got started with a terrific keynote and some very cool product announcements. You can now download free Express editions of each of the Visual Studio products: C#, VB, C++, Web Developer, and even a light-weight SQL engine, SQL Express. <a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/">Pick them up off MSDN</a>.
