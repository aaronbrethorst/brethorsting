Another oldie-but-goodie: <a href="http://www.brandchannel.com">BrandChannel.com</a> (which I'm becoming addicted to) published an article back in 2004 about <a href="http://www.brandchannel.com/features_effect.asp?pf_id=234">Detroit's efforts to shed its "toothless and anarchic" image</a>. Detroit had a significant opportunity to pull off an effective, widely-visible rebranding campaign with the then-forthcoming Ryder Cup and Superbowl.

  Did it work? It appears that <a href="http://www.visitdetroit.com/">Detroit's made a lot of progress</a>, with recent studies showing that <a href="http://www.visitdetroit.com/media/pressreleases/detail.asp?ContentId=1807F132-5015-432A-AFB9-2759C4C6824E&QueueId=1&Tchpnt=2&Cat=&Aud=-99&CrGetMethod=10011&FirstCall=N&CntStartDate=1/16/1971&CntEndDate=1/16/2399&ContentTypeId=7">Detroit's downtown crime rate is 26% below the national average</a>, and that <a href="http://www.detinvfund.com/">investments</a> are being made to revitalize the city.

  Today, it still appears that Turin, Italy is still trouncing Detroit on the (motor-related) image front, with Fiat acting as a principal sponsor of the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006">2006 Winter Games</a>, but only time will tell how this all turns out.
