I noticed on Techmeme yesterday that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/technology/circuits/02novelties.html">Popfly received a great writeup in the New York Times</a> as part of a broader article in <em>Circuits</em> about mashups. Here's a quote from the article:

  <blockquote>Now mash-ups are poised to hit the mainstream, and to spread well beyond music. Yahoo, I.B.M., Microsoft and others are creating systems to let ordinary people whoâ€™ve never been near a Java class create useful computer applications by combining, or "mashing up," different online information sources.</blockquote>

  It's great to see consumer-focused mashup platforms in general, and Popfly in particular, get attention from the NYT.

  Incidentally, I agree with the NYT: mashups are poised to hit the mainstream, and have a serious impact on the development of software. <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2007/08/is_popfly_the_harbinger_of_web_30.html">So does Eric Schmidt</a>. Of course, being a little bit skeptical is never a bad thing, and It's hard for me to say where we are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner's_Hype_Cycle">the hype cycle</a> of mashups. What do you think? Best thing since sliced bread or a lot of hot air?
