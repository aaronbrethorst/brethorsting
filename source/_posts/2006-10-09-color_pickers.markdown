I needed a color picker control for a project I'm working on in my free time (which I hope will see the light of day in the next week or two!). I ran across a couple very nice-looking ones during a cursory search. Hopefully they'll prove useful to someone else.

  First is Danny Blanchard's <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/adobe_cp_clone_part_1.asp">Adobe Color Picker Clone at CodeProject</a>. It is pretty much what it sounds like. It seems quite nice, and it's unfortunate that there is no explicit licensing information included with the sample, which makes me a little wary about using it.

  Second is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/07/GDIColorPicker">a color picker demo'd in MSDN Magazine a couple years back</a>. It looks like it could easily meet my needs, and it looks like the UI should be easy to bring up to Windows Ux standards. The licensing terms are also very clearly stated, which is a perk, too.
