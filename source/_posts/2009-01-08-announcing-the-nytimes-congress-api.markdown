<blockquote>The initial release exposes four types of data: a list of members for a given Congress and chamber, details of a specific roll-call vote, biographical and role information about a specific member of Congress, and a memberâ€™s most recent positions on roll-call votes.</blockquote>
The NYTimes just announced their Congress data API. Data is served up via a Rails app that uses _why's Hpricot gem to parse XML from the House website and HTML from the Senate website.

I've been waiting for something like this for a long time, and I'm excited to see it built and maintained by the New York Times. They've been on quite a tear lately in producing web services, and I can't wait to see what's next.
