I don't know why this never occurred to me before today, but it struck me that the Kindle Fire would be a great system on which to play old-school video games. I'm not a big fan of the virtual controller setup, but I bet that the 7" screen would work way better than a bitty little 3.5 or 4" screen. So, I think I'm going to have to play around with this in the next couple days and see what my old go-to game, Final Fantasy VI, looks like on the Fire.

To that end, I found this <a href='http://www.kindlefireemulators.com/pages/3-super-nintendo-entertainment-system-snes'>Android (or Kindle Fire) emulator for the SNES</a> that ought to work for me. Let's see what happens; I'm excited! (and yes, for the record, I do own FFVI. Or 3, I suppose.)
