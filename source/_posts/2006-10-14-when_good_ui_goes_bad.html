Dave Vronay has a post up on shell revealed about <a href="http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/10/09/Features-that-didn_2700_t-make-the-cut.aspx">features that didn't quite make it into Windows Vista</a>, like Mimesweeper, not-very-safe Delete and a TECO interpreter for the Start Menu:
  <blockquote>This was really a great feature, and it was nice to cater to the power users for a change and not coddle up to wimpy users who need sissy languages like EMACS to get anything done.  It was also a low dev hit.  An anaysis of the 350 million lines of windows source code revealed that there were four unused TECO interpreters in there already, so it was very easy to add a fifth one.</blockquote>
