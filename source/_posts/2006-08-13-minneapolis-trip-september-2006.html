Yo, I'll be back in Minneapolis for a week next month. I haven't finalized the details yet, but it looks like the dates will be from Sunday, September 10 - Sunday, September 17. I am coming back for a Microsoft recruiting event at the <a href="http://www.umn.edu">U of MN</a>. Hit me up if you want to get together: 425-241-4008.

  Unrelated Side-Note #1: The career fair at the U starts on Tuesday the 12th, which means that I should actually fly in on Monday sometime, except that I refuse to fly on 9/11 now.

  Unrelated Side-Note #2: While I was digging up the MS College Recruiting website, I happened upon a profile of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/college/ft_fiona.mspx">Fiona</a>, one of the devs on my team. It's always rather amusing for me to run into profiles like this of people I know :-).
