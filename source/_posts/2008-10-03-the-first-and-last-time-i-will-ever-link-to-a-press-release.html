<blockquote>WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Slate, the daily online magazine, today announced a partnership with Chimp Software to provide campaign poll tracking data to the “Election ‘08” iPhone application. By incorporating data from Slate’s Election Scorecard into the “Election ‘08” app, users will now have an instant update on which candidate is leading the presidential race, plus a comprehensive breakdown of the numbers in each state, right on an iPhone.

“People crave information during this election, and Slate’s Election Scorecard has been a destination online for an instant look at what’s happening in the polls. We wanted to combine that addictive content with technology that lets users have this data whenever they want, wherever they want, to create a meaningful mobile experience around the elections,” said David Plotz, Slate’s Editor.

Software developer Aaron Brethorst of Chimp Software first created the “Election ‘08” app, which is now called “Slate Poll Tracker ’08” with the addition of Slate campaign data.

This application can be downloaded for $ .99 from Apple’s App Store on iPhone and iPod touch. Users can find the feature in the iPhone App Store.
