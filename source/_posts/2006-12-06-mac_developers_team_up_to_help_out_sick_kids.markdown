On Thursday, December 7th, I and several other small Mac developers will donate all of our day's product proceeds to Penny Arcade's <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org">Child's Play charity</a>, which gives toys, games, movies, and other fun things to children's hospitals around the world. Child's Play was created to help make sick kids' stays in children's hospitals that much better.

Buying a copy of <a href="http://chimpsoftware.com">iRooster</a> from me tomorrow means that a child in Seattle, Vancouver, Liverpool, Albequerque or many other cities will have another game to play or a movie to watch while they're recovering in the hospital.

Learn more about what we're doing, and find out which other Mac developers are donating their proceeds at the <a href="http://ironcoder.org/blog/childs-play-day/">Ironcoder Child's Play Day website</a>. Also, you don't need to buy iRooster to help out. Check out the Child's Play website to find out how to donate money or toys directly to their designated children's hospitals.

<blockquote>Since 2003, gamers have banded together through registered Seattle-based charity, Child's Play. Over a million dollars in donations of toys, games, books and cash for sick kids in children's hospitals across North America and the world have been collected since our inception.

We collect no administrative fees or other charges, 100% of all gifts and donations go directly to our partner hospitals, to help make life a little brighter for a sick child.

This year, we have continued expanding across the country and the globe. With over 25 partner hospitals and more arriving every month, you can be sure to find one from the map above that needs your help! You can choose to purchase requested items from their online retailer wish lists, or make a cash donation that helps out Child's Play hospitals everywhere. Any items purchased through Amazon or DStore will be shipped directly to your hospital of choice, please be sure to select their shipping address rather than your own.

When gamers give back, it makes a difference!</blockquote>
