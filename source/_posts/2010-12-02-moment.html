<em>Pick one moment during which you felt most alive this year. Describe it in vivid detail (texture, smells, voices, noises, colors).</em>

Most alive this year? In vivid detail? There's one moment that comes to mind that, for legal/contractual reasons, I cannot discuss. (long story, don't ask. nothing bad; just dumb.)

I can, however, cite one thing that I can imagine in vivid detail that <em>will</em> happen this year: my girlfriend, Naomi, and I made the decision to spend Christmas in Maui instead of visiting family in the Bay Area or Twin Cities this year. And, I can say without any hint of hyperbole: I can <em>taste</em> those Mai Tais, I can <em>smell</em> that sea salt-flecked air, I can <em>hear</em> that ocean current lapping over my body, I can <em>touch</em> that sandy beach, I can <em>see</em> that taxi cab pulling up at 4:30AM to take me to the airport...in only another 19 days.
