I was about to write a somber and fairly normal post announcing that I had just released <a href="http://www.sixdollarchimp.com/irooster.php">iRooster 2.1 Beta 1</a>, and that you should go download it right now, because it kicks ass... But I need to change that all around now.

  Instead, I want to announce that I've released version 2.1 beta 1 of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/business/yourmoney/16digi.html">your own personal orgiastic boogaloo alarm clock</a> (reg required, suck it up and type in the info).

  Anyway, long story short: iRooster 2.1 kicks ass. It adds a ton of great new features, and a number of bug fixes that everyone's been asking for forever now. Peace, love, and rock n' roll, everyone. Go wake up in style.
