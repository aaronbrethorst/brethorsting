  I love that Apple highlights the applications for their platform that they consider to be the absolute best (even though I've never won one ;-), and I wish Microsoft did it, too. With tens or hundreds of thousands of applications available for Windows, it can be really difficult to find the absolute best applications out there. Maybe I'll do an Aaron's Design Awards for Windows sometime soon ;-)
