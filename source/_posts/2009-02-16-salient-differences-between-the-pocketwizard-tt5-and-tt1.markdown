Update: one question I still had was whether you could use a TT1/TT5 on your camera and II+s on remote strobes and still take advantage of a higher sync speed. <a href="http://robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-9884-9903">According to Rob Galbraith</a>: yes. 

I've been reading through <a href="http://www.pocketwizard.com/products/images/TT1-C.pdf">the user manual for the PocketWizard TT5 and MiniTT1 units</a>, and I wanted to highlight a few things that stand out at me.

<ol>
	<li>According to PocketWizard, the TT5 will cost $219, and the MiniTT1 will cost $199. This is a small jump over the II+'s $189 pricetag, but not astronomical in either case. Besides, both units are cheaper than RadioPopper's <a href="http://shop.radiopopper.com/">PX system</a>.</li>
	<li>The MiniTT1 is a transmitter only. If you need the transceiver capabilities, like the II+ offers, you need to pick up the TT5.</li>
	<li>Both the TT1 and the TT5 are compatible with the II+ and MultiMax units. If you already have an investment in existing PW hardware, you're not going to lose anything by buying in to the new system.</li>
	<li>The TT1 does not appear to have a remote camera port on it. To get this functionality, it looks like you'll need to get a TT5.</li>
	<li>As a corollary, The TT5 is not compatible with the CM-N3-P remote trigger cable (which, of course, I own. damn.). It requires the CM-N3-ACC cable instead. On the plus side of things, the TT5 should be entirely capable of triggering a II+ attached to your camera, and firing the camera with the CM-N3-P, so it's not the end of the world.</li>
	<li>Ostensibly, the MiniTT1 has a poorer range than the TT5, given its built-in antenna. I haven't seen anything discussing the range differences between the two units, though.</li>
</ol>
