I just received word that my application to PhotoShelter, a fantastic stock photography service, was accepted. <a href="http://psc.photoshelter.com/user/aaronbrethorst">You can check out my profile</a> to see the four images of mine (out of 10) that were accepted. woo-hoo! Hopefully, my camera equipment will actually pay for itself at some point :)
