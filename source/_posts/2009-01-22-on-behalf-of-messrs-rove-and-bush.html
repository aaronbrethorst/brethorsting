Via the New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/us/politics/22web-baker.html?_r=1&amp;hp">On Plane to Texas, Critiques of the Speech</a>:
<blockquote>Mr. Rove, who was on the plane to Texas, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that as his former boss departed Washington, "in a last angry frenzy his critics again distorted his record, maligned his character and repeated untruths about his years in the Oval Office," adding that "nothing they wrote or said changes the essential facts."

Mr. Rove went on to define Mr. Bushâ€™s legacy as the two of them see it. The former president, he wrote, was ultimately right about Iraq and right about his tactics in the war on terrorism.</blockquote>
Karl's absolutely right. There's no way us wacky liberals could ever change the essential facts that underlay the eight years of graft, corruption and frat boyish stupidity from which our nation emerged this past Tuesday. It is, however, news to me that former President Bush was "ultimately right" on Iraq. I wonder how Karl defines this. Surely he mustn't refer to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3570845.stm">those non-existent weapons of mass destruction</a>. Nor, I presume, does he refer to former Vice President Cheney's belief that "we will be greeted as liberators," which Mr. Cheney presumably pulled from an undisclosed location on his posterior.

Actually, I think I've got it. Karl must be referring to the fact that we've done a pretty good job of beating back Al Qaeda in Iraq over the past year or two. "But Aaron," you say, "surely you jest! Al Qaeda wasn't even <em>in</em> Iraq until we invaded in 2003!" To that, I shall rebut your senseless liberal logic and rational fact-spewing with <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/15/bush-acknowledges-absence_n_151144.html">a pearl of wisdom from former President Bush</a>:
<blockquote>Yeah, that's right, so what?</blockquote>
Heckuva job, Bushie.
