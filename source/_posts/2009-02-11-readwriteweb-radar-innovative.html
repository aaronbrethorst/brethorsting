<blockquote>Outside.in's new iPhone application Radar (not to be confused with the photo-sharing iPhone app also called Radar) delivers location-based content including news, blog posts, and tweets to your iPhone. Once installed, the app will geo-locate you upon being launched to deliver the news within 1000 feet of where you are standing, from your neighborhood, or from the entire city. You can also load up Radar with profiles for various locales, including your home, office, and more. Shake the app to switch from the news listings to the map view. (U.S. only)</blockquote>
Nice recognition.
