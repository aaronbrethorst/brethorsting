Looking over <a href="http://www.scottkelby.com/blog/2009/archives/3221">Joey Lawrence's recent work in Africa</a> makes me wonder what I'm doing with my life. Perhaps, more importantly, it makes me wonder if I'm pushing myself in the wrong direction. A very strange thought, after dedicating myself to one single thing for a decade. Or perhaps it's just indicative that 10 years is enough.
