I have spent the past seven years convinced that I am in the process of losing my hair. The evidence seems to suggest I will. Neither of my grandfathers had hair. My dad doesn't have much. It looks like my fate is pretty much sealed.

  I resolved long ago that I was going to take this-when it came-like a man. No combovers, no freaky-ass plug surgery. Instead, I will take the Patrick Stewart route: simple, shaved, cool. Additionally, if I can pretend to be a French spaceship captain who just happens to have a British accent for some unknown reason then more power to me. I'm sure the ladies would love it.

  Anyway, what brought this topic to mind this evening was a great post from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/06/combover_the_movie.html">Mark Frauenfelder over on Boing-Boing</a>. It's about "Combover: The Movie." Now, I have no idea whether or not this is real, and frankly, I don't really care. It's just damned funny.
