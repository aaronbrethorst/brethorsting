I was introduced to a fantastic artist (tragically not in person) last night named <a href="http://www.takashimurakami.com/">Takashi Murakami</a>. He's credited with creating the superflat style,
<blockquote>[Which] is characterized by flat planes of color and graphic images involving a character style derived from anime and manga. Superflat is an artistic style that comments on otaku lifestyle and subculture, as well as consumerism and sexual fetishism.</blockquote>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Murakami">according to Wikipedia</a>.

You might have seen Murakami's work on the cover of Kanye West's album, Graduation.
