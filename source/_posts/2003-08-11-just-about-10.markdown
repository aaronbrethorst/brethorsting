Ok, almost there. I think I crossed the last big hurdle with getting iRooster ready for official 1.0 GM status. This is cool: my first real piece of shipped software (beating out this wee little office suite I worked on last summer for first release). Too bad I won't get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060987049/">Ship-It Award</a> or anything, but hopefully I'll still get some <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=74053&cid=6652688">filthy lucre</a> for my troubles.

A note to anyone thinking about writing shareware on Mac OS X: regardless of how easy it is to write Cocoa apps (it is easy), it's still a gargantuan pain in the ass to write software intended for use by the general public. I have nearly limitless respect for anyone involved in actually shipping software.
