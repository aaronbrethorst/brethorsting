Ray Ozzie, the Chief Software Architect of Microsoft, has an interesting demo of "webifying" the clipboard on his blog. The so-called <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html">Live Clipboard</a> allows a user to interact with rich data on a webpage in a fashion that is much more akin to a traditional rich client application, <a href="http://rayozzie.spaces.msn.com/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">as Ray discusses more here</a>.

  Although what is publicly visible is only demoware at this point, I'd be shocked if we didn't see this stuff in a lot of web apps in the near future. It only makes good sense, after all.
