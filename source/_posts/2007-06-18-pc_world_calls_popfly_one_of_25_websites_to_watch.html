<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132787-page,2-c,sites/article.html">This is always a nice way to start a week</a>:
  <blockquote>If you haven't already discovered the world of mashups, Microsoft's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.popfly.com/">Popfly</a> is a good place to start. Mashups combine multiple Web-based sites or applications to produce all sorts of useful things, such as an overlay of traffic information over Google Maps. With Popfly, you can create your own mashups--and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,132028/article.html">you don't have to know a lick of code </a>to do it. Just drag prefab building blocks, connect them, and you have an instant mashup that you can add to an existing Web page or turn into its own site. For example, you can easily produce a mashup that grabs pictures from a site like Flickr and then displays them in a rotating cube.</blockquote>
