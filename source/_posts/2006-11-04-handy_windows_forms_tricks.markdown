CodeGuru has <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/columns/dotnet/article.php/c12761/">a great article on Winforms tricks</a> that will improve the fit and finish of your application, such as optimizing databinding and using the built-in PropertyGrid control in .NET FX 2.0. It's short, but you might learn something that will make your Winforms app that much more polished.
