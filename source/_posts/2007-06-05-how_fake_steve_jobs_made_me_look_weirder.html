I'm writing specs for our next Popfly iteration at the Starbucks down the street from my apartment, and decided to take a quick break by reading through my email and news feeds (sorry, I can't tell you what the specs cover). I came across one posting from <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/06/caption.html">Fake Steve Jobs</a> that made me laugh out loud, eliciting strange and confused looks from the people around me.

  God, I love the Interweb. Also, if you're not familiar with Fake Steve, I highly recommend spending some time reading through his blog, or pre-ordering his book from Amazon. <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/top/steve-jobs-meet-steve-jobs-264251.php">Valleywag's been working themselves into a lather</a> for the past few weeks trying to unmask the man behind the mask, as it were, but have yet to crack the case.
