I have secret inside word that Digg is about to release an update to their site featuring new categories that will help their users find the topics they care about the most that much quicker! Check it out: now you no longer have to go hunting to find photos of lolcats or HDR imagery, or stories about Kevin Rose! This is awesome!

  (btw, I do read Digg on a daily basis, but usually just stick to <a href="http://www.digg.com/design">the Design section</a> ;-) )
