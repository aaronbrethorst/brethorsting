Instapundit just <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/014937.php">bashed Bush and praised Kerry</a>. Holy cow! Seriously, though. The Bush Administration's "War on Porn" is the most ill-conceived plan I've heard about since just before Sept 11 2001. This feels like more of the really weird, hare-brained schemes they came up with just before Bush redefined himself as a "War President."
