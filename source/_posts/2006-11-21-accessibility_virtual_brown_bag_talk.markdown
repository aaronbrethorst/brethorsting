Anna Bradley, the CEO of Criterion 508 Solutions, will be giving a talk at the <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/">Access Board</a>, a Federal agency for accessibility, on December 13th. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any clear sense of what Anna will actually be talking about. I assume she will be talking about accessibility (especially since that's what Criterion does), but more details appear to be lacking. Still, this may be quite interesting. If you have a spare hour I recommend checking it out.

  More information, including instructions for accessing the voice bridge or real-time transcript, <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/training.htm">is also available at the Access Board website</a>.
