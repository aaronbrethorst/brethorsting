Tantek Ã‡elik of Technorati, Microsoft, and W3C fame published a great article a few weeks back on how to create and serve better XHTML in eight easy steps. I missed this when it first came out, so maybe you haven't seen it either. It's all great stuff in any case, and eminently practical, <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/08/to_hell_with_web_standards.html">unlike some others out there on the web</a>. Anyway, enough bitterness; <a href="http://www.tantek.com/log/2006/07.html#d27t1218">Tantek's thoughts are more interesting</a>:
  <ol>
  <li>Validate your web pages.</li>
  <li>Eliminate layout tables and spacer gifs.</li>
  <li>Get rid of meta tags for keywords.</li>
  <li>Use meaningful CSS class names, and don't tie them directly to your presentation.</li>
  <li>Get rid of useless whitespace in your code <em>[aaron: it bugs me when outputted HTML is not pretty-printed with proper spacing and tabbing. I go through a fair amount of pain to make sure that the stuff I create at least looks tolerable (that is, when I'm not using templates ;-)].</em></li>
  <li>Use rel and hreflang for localized content.</li>
  <li>Cut out commented markup on the server side.</li>
  <li>Add an hcard to your site <em>[aaron: not that Tantek's biased about this one, or anything ;-)].</em></li>
  </ol>
