<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/">Sara Ford</a>, formerly the de facto head of Accessibility testing for all of Visual Studio (and a Black Belt in Karate, so don't mess with her), published a handy-dandy utility for verifying the correctness of common MSAA properties and roles on <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=678c467f-3724-40f0-9de7-db440e4fa148">GotDotNet</a> back in 2004. Source is included in VB.NET-form.

  MSAA, or Microsoft Active Accessibility, is the technology used to supply additional information describing a user interface, in order to allow users dependent upon assistive technologies the ability to interact with Windows software. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnanchor/html/accessibility.asp">There's a wealth of information on MSDN about MSAA</a>.
