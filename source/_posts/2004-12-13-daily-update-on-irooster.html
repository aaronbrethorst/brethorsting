I didn't work on iRooster at all today, but I spent 30 minutes on the Update Manager I have planned. I've decided that it'll be easier than trying to email all of my registered users every time a new major update comes out, and far more polite too. Plus, it seems like a decent marketing vector for me should I ever choose to come out with new Mac software (answer: I probably will someday).
