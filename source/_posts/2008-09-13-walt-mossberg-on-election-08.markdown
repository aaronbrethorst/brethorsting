<a href="http://mossblog.allthingsd.com/20080913/follow-the-election-anywhere/">Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal wrote about Election '08 today</a>:
<blockquote>Now there’s a cool new way to follow the 2008 Presidential election anywhere you go...If you care about politics, and understand that polls aren’t perfect, Election ‘08 can put a snapshot of the political horse race in your pocket.</blockquote>
Wow! Appearing on TechCrunch is one thing, but getting written up by Mossberg just made my week!
