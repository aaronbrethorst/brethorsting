From David Plouffe in The Audacity to Win:

<blockquote>There have been plenty of organizations that thrive, for a time at least, under leaders who yell and scream and fly off the handle and are propelled forward by a culture of intimidation and even fear. But I believe that, ultimately, organizations are collectives of human beings. They will perform best and make their greatest achievements when there is clarity, calmness, conviction, and collegiality throughout the ranks.</blockquote>

The 2008 Obama campaign may be one of the best-run Presidential campaigns in history, and a lot of it comes down to attitudes like Plouffe's. There's a lot here that new managers in the software industry can and should learn from. Corporations, just like political campaigns and soylent green, are made of people.
