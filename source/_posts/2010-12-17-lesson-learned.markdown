<p><em>What was the best thing you learned about yourself this past year? And how will you apply that lesson going forward?</em></p>
<p>That I was capable of accomplishing anything I wanted. That the only real practical limitations I can see for myself are physical ones. That's not to say that I can go off and do anything, but I can do an amount of stuff great enough that it would take me a lifetime to catch up to my own limitations. and, frankly, I think that's pretty awesome.</p>
