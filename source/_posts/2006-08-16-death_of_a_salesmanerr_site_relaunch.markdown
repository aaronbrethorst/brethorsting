Jared Spool of User Interface Engineering published a fascinating article way back in 2003 about the <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/death_of_relaunch/">death of the major site relaunch</a>:
  <blockquote>[T]he best sites have replaced this process of revolution with a new process of subtle evolution. Entire redesigns have quietly faded away with continuous improvements taking their place.

  The big survivors of the dot-com crash -- Amazon, eBay, Dell, Google, Yahoo, and CNN -- have each foregone the big redesign in lieu of continual changes on the site. The changes are so fluid that users hardly notice. </blockquote>

  The article centers around what I would imagine is a pretty common scenario: a small company that has become totally dependent upon its dated, unusable, and ugly website. Jared's recommendation is to follow the examples of the big web-based firms and slowly evolve your site design towards something you wouldn't be embarassed to show your mom, instead of embracing radical (buggy, expensive, time-consuming) change. The same principle applies to software development. It's rarely advisable to throw out your entire codebase and try to rewrite from scratch. After all, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">look at what happened to Netscape when they tried it</a>.

  Jared makes a note that many users don't even realize that Amazon, eBay, Yahoo, and others have slowly morphed their pages over the past several years. If you go back and take a look at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001219015600/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/">Amazon from the end of 2000</a>, their site looks dated but very close in form to today's appearance.

  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961022175331/http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft's website from 1996</a> looks quite different from its present appearance, but the change was (once again) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.microsoft.com">evolutionary and not revolutionary</a>.
