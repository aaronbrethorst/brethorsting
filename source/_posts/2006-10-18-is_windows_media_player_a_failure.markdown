No, I don't think it is. On the contrary, Windows Media Player 11 is actually my favorite media player on the market, handily beating iTunes 7 in terms of speed, usability, and aesthetics. That said, <a href="http://www.mstechtoday.com/2006/10/12/pondering-the-future-of-windows-media-player/">as it was put in MS Tech Today:</a>
  <blockquote>I’m confused about Microsoft’s choice of having Zune utilize a completely seperate player/music management...[Microsoft is] going to be pushing Zune hard - does that mean they will be pushing WMP 11 less? </blockquote>

  Interestingly, I have no more sense of what's happening over there with WMP and Zune than anyone else. I love WMP 11, and I hope that WMP 12 is soon in coming.
