NewDonkey, the Sharp Edge of the Vital Center, <a href="http://www.newdonkey.com/2006/01/bloodied-but-unbowed.html">had this to say about his Holiday Season</a>: "[My car] was loudly sounding an apocalyptic blooga-blooga-blooga by the time I reached Arlington." Never once have I though to use the words "apocalyptic" and "blooga-blooga-blooga" together in the same sentence. Never again, shall I make that mistake.

  Oh yeah, and <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/gallery/v/newyears06/">New Year's Eve pix are up now too</a>.
