I just received word from Apple that Election '08 has been updated to version 1.1. This brings with it a raft of improvements, including:
<ul>
	<li>Battleground states: See which races are the closest at the touch of a button.</li>
	<li>Polling sources: See the sources of every state poll displayed.</li>
	<li>Historical polling data: See every poll conducted in 2008.</li>
	<li>National tracking polls: See who's winning the nation-wide horse race with numbers updated every day.</li>
	<li>Poll smoothing algorithm improvements: State poll leads are calculated using a smoothing algorithm that take all of the latest polls into account.</li>
</ul>
