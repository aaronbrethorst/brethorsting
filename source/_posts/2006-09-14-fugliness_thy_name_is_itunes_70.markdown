While I was off recruiting impressionable, young college students to come join Microsoft over the past two days, Apple announced a slew of updates, including a new version of iTunes. Unfortunately, <a href="http://dsandler.org/wp/archives/2006/09/12/other-it7-commentary">Apple seems to have beaten iTunes 7 with the ugly stick.</a> The best-looking new feature in the product seems oddly reminiscent of another media player, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/music.aspx">but I just can't put my finger on which one...</a>

  In all seriousness, though, iTunes 7 does seem to have some nice features, but the UI has taken a major step backwards. I feel somewhat compelled to mimic its UI in iRooster, but it'll hurt to do so. A lot.

  More round-ups are located on <a href="http://dsandler.org/wp/archives/2006/09/12/other-it7-commentary">another page on the aforementioned site</a>.
