Although I appreciate <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/09/cognitive-dissonance.html">Nate Silver's detailed, attentive analysis of Sarah Palin</a>, I must take umbrage at this characterization of us as "Daily Kos reading, merlot-drinking [liberals]." I don't fucking drink merlot, and lately I've been more of a malbec person.
