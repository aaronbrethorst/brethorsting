In retrospect, you can always say to yourself: "yep, that's the exact point in time where everything changed." Hindsight is 20/20, especially when you're examining massive changes in your life. What's really tricky is spotting them before they've rushed by (or over) you. Of course, you can always grab the bull by the horns and force yourself through an inflection point.

  I feel like I'm rapidly approaching an inflection point in my life, and that it's up to me to control which way it takes me. We'll see what happens; it's probably a few months away, but I'll write more about it as it occurs.
