Safari 1.0 (on Jag 10.2.6) seems to go absolutely bazonkers with my stylesheet (Georgia Blue on Movable Type 2.64). This sucks. A lot. I think that it will be rectified once I put more entries into the weblog, but who the hell knows. What's happening, at least on my computer (I'm sure that it looks fine on MSIE 6), is that the bottom few tables on the right hand side of the screen bleed all the way to the left side. Crud. Weird. Etc.

update:
yep, having a 2nd posting fixed the problem.

update#2:
"it's a feature, not a bug!" thanks for the tip, raena. i honestly was completely unaware of that. :-)
