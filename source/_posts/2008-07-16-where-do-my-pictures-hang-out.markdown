I Just found another place where one of my pictures has been used recently. The local NPR affiliate, KUOW, had a call-in program with Ron Sims, King County Executive, and used my picture of him from the Gay Pride Parade <a href="http://kuow.org/program.php?id=15303">for the website blurb</a>. Neat!Â
