<a href="http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/02/you-buy-virtual-goods.html">Regarding IMVU's choice of target market</a>:
<blockquote>[When] given the choice, try and move up the hierarchy of value. If given the opportunity to work with two customer segments, one of which sees your product as a basic utility and another of which sees it as a lifestyle statement, choose the latter. IMVU made that choice early on, when we abandoned some profitable customers who wanted to use our product as a regular-IM substitute. There was no way to service them while still engaging with the goths, emos and anime fans who were rapidly becoming IMVU's top evangelists. We doubled-down on identity value, and it worked out well.</blockquote>
