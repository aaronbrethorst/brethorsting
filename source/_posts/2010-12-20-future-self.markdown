<em>Imagine yourself five years from now. What advice would you give your current self for the year ahead? (Bonus: Write a note to yourself 10 years ago. What would you tell your younger self?)</em>

33 year old me to 29 year old me: Never give in to fear. 28 year old me to 18 year old me: never give in to fear.
