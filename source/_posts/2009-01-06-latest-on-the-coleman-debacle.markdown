<a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/01/06/coleman_statement/">From the Associated Press</a> (via MPR):
<blockquote>
<p class="regular">The lawsuit alleges that the Canvassing Board made mistakes when determining voter intent on challenged ballots, that ineligible voters cast ballots and that some absentee ballots were erroneously opened early, raising chain-of-custody concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="regular">which, is funny because, <a href="http://mnpublius.com/2009/01/we-have-a-winner-seriously-this-time/">as MNpublius notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>[Ritchie] pointed out that 95 percent of the Canvassing Boardâ€™s decisions, including the most significant ones, were unanimous.</blockquote>
To quote my favorite Al Franken book, again:
<blockquote>What a dick!</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>See, he's a dick!</blockquote>
Update: Here's the video from the Coleman press conference.
