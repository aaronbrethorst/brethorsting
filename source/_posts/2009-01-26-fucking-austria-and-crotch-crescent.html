<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1017" title="23crapstone3_190" src="http://brethorsting.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/23crapstone3_190.jpg" alt="23crapstone3_190" width="190" height="126" />Years ago, I was forwarded a link to a bug in the Mappoint team's bug database. It was entitled "<a href="http://netnatter.blogspot.com/2004/06/fcking-villagers-vote-against-name.html">There is no Fucking Austria</a>," which argued that there was a serious deficiency in our mapping product, due to its lack of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucking,_Austria">the best-named town in all of Austria</a>.

I was reminded of this a few minutes ago by an article I came across in the NYT, discussing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/world/europe/23crapstone.html?em">the best of the worst town names in the United Kingdom:</a>
<blockquote>In the scale of embarrassing place names, Crapstone ranks pretty high. But Britain is full of them. Some are mostly amusing, like Ugley, Essex; East Breast, in western Scotland; North Piddle, in Worcestershire; and Spanker Lane, in Derbyshire.

Others evoke images that may conflict with residentsâ€™ efforts to appear dignified when, for example, applying for jobs.

These include Crotch Crescent, Oxford; Titty Ho, Northamptonshire; Wetwang, East Yorkshire; Slutshole Lane, Norfolk; and Thong, Kent.</blockquote>
