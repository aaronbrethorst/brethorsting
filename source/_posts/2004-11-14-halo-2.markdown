Halo 2 is fucking awesome. There's really no other way I can describe it than that. I only have a few gripes:

  1. The ending. I have to wait another 3 years or so to find out what happens after this. Damn it.
  2. Matchmaking seems to take forever. Hopefully, the good guys at Bungie will take care of this soon.

  Half-Life 2 comes out next week, as does Metal Gear Solid 3, if I am not mistaken. Good times.
