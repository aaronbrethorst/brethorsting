Mark Johnston, a Microsoft developer evangelist in the UK, has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/markjo/archive/2007/06/18/slide-7-session-slides-and-demos.aspx">a bunch of great Silverlight-related content</a> up that covers topics like:
  <ul>
  	<li>The fundamentals</li>
  	<li>Animations and Javascript programming</li>
  	<li>1.1 debugging</li>
  	<li>A 1 line of code video player</li>
  	<li>Silverlight Streaming (which I can vouch for as being totally awesome, and incredibly easy to use - I built our video players for Popfly with it and Expression Media Encoder in next to no time)</li>
  </ul>
