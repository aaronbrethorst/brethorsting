Jared Spool, noted usability guy and <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/08/31/introducing-the-spoolcast-crew/">wiseass</a> (read his bio), introduces the Spoolcast, a roundtable podcast, covering a variety of topics. <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/08/31/spoolcast-1-what-has-brown-done-for-you-part-1/">Episode 1 includes the following topics</a> (and thankfully does not feature a Jamaican alien with floppy ears):
  <blockquote>What can we learn from the new Brown University web site?
  What does it mean to be usable?
  Why is MySpace so successful?
  Which is better designed, the new Brown Web Site or Craigslist?
  How important is the design of a home page? (I think not so much. Everyone else disagrees.)
  The value of social networking
  The UPA Body of Knowledge project
  The design experience, as it applies to conference design</blockquote>

  Fascinating stuff, and well worth the listen.
