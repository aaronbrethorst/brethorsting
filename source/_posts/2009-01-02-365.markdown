Ever heard of <a href="http://www.photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day">a 365 project</a>? It's where you shoot and post one photo every day for an entire year. It sounds straightforward, but it actually represents a huge time commitment. I've been thinking about doing one for a while, and finally worked up the gumption to start it yesterday.

There's nothing inherent about the project that suggests you have to start on January 1st, but it seemed like an appropriate time for me. It will be interesting to me to a) see if I can sustain this for an entire year, and b) see how my photography evolves over the course of the project. At the end of the day, I see it as being as much about the journey (becoming a better photographer and challenging myself creatively) as it is about the destination (posting all 365 photos).

If you have the time, check out some of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/project_365/">the great 365s on Flickr</a>; there are some incredibly creative people around, like this bloke, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aknacer/3098969247/">Aaron Nace</a>, who is in the last few months of his 365. I've been following Aaron's photography for months, now, and I'm consistently blown away by the quality and creativity of virtually every single picture he posts.

I've started off my 365 with portraits, and I'm hoping to continue this with a new theme for every week of the year. I have no idea where I'll come up with 52 separate themes, but hopefully they'll suggest themselves to me over time.

I'm sure I'll fall back on my typical landscape photographs periodically, but I'd like to use this as an opportunity to really push myself and grow as a photographer, which means getting outside of my comfort zone and potentially shooting a lot of crap.
