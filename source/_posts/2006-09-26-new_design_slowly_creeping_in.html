I became tired of my rather pathetic looking <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com">home page</a>, and redesigned it a while back. I put the project on hold about two weeks ago when my priorities dictated otherwise, and didn't have a chance to resume the project until today. I hope to replicate this theme (or a variant thereof) across the full body of my site in the future. No timeframe, of course :-) ... after all, site redesigns are considered harmful, right?

  What do you think of the new look?
