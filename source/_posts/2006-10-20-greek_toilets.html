  <blockquote>For some incomprehensible reason, sewer pipes in Greece are of such small calibre that toilet paper invariably clogs them up causing a calamitous backup of sewage. So, instead of being dropped into the pan, used toilet paper must be shoved into a plastic bin provided next to the pedestal.</blockquote>
