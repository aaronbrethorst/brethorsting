Stodgy Seattle corporate law firm, Perkins Coie, is defending Osama Bin Laden's former bodyguard and chauffeur. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/dannywestneat/2002898905_danny30.html">The rationale</a>: <em>Yes, they're helping a suspected terrorist. But it's not an example of "you're with us or you're with them." It's what makes us better than them.</em> Amen to that.
