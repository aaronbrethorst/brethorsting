<em>How has a friend changed you or your perspective on the world this year? Was this change gradual, or a sudden burst?</em>

The loss of an important friendship earlier this year left me extremely angry and frustrated. Both because I felt like the other person was blaming me for a situation for which they rightfully shared a lot of blame, and because I didn't want it to affect me as much as it did. What I finally realized was that I was looking for a simple apology. One that I don't think will ever come.

The change itself occurred over the course of a couple months as I grew to realize that the other person had no idea what motivated me, why I did what I did, and why their behavior simply made me increasingly angry over time. Perhaps it was like a dam bursting: it comes out as a sudden burst, but it's the gradual increase of pressure over a long period that makes it so explosive.
