I just read something <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17707922/">on MSNBC</a> that reminded me of Penny Arcade's <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19">John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory</a>. Essentially, a 400 pound woman didn't realize she was pregnant until two days before she gave birth to a perfectly healthy child. You know what: there's no reason to mock her, to say things like “A pig is a pig.” Should she strive to eat better and exercise more? Sure. I could say the same about myself, and you could probably say the same, too.

  There's no reason to take your insecurities or your sense of pettiness out on other people, even in an anonymous forum, just because you can. If there is one thing that differentiates us from thirteen year old boys on Xbox Live, it is our sense of civility.
