A while back I wrote about a new snipping tool included with Windows Vista. I just found <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/10/19/Window-Clippings-1.2.aspx">an even cooler one</a> just now that leverages Vista's DWM to create perfect screen captures on Vista every time, as seen in the screenshot below:

  You'll notice that the background doesn't bleed through, nor do you get ugly rectangular black borders around your screenshot. Many thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/default.aspx">Kenny Kerr</a> for providing such an awesome, useful utility!
