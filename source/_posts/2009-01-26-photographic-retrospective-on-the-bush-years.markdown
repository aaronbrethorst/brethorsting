Great article from Errol Morris on the NYT website <a href="http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall/?hp">highlighting the most meaningful photographs from Bush's 8 years in office</a>.
<blockquote>During the last week of the Bush administration, I asked the head photo editors of these news services — Vincent Amalvy (AFP), Santiago Lyon (AP) and Jim Bourg (Reuters) — to pick the photographs of the president that they believe captured the character of the man and of his administration. There are overlapping pictures — of the president with a bullhorn at Ground Zero, of the president looking out the window of Air Force One over New Orleans, of the president receiving the news on the morning of 9/11. It is interesting that these pictures are different. They may be of the same scene, but they have different content. They speak in a different way.</blockquote>
