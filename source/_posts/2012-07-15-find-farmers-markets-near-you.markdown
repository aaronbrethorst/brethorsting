Earlier today it struck me that, although I know about and frequent the Broadway Farmers Market, there are a ton of other markets in the Seattle area that I never go to. I went off to find out how many, and was surprised to discover that there appear to be no less than fifteen Farmers Markets in and around Seattle. From there, I started wondering how many there were across the United States. I happened upon a dataset hosted on [Data.gov](http://www.data.gov) that pegged the answer as being around 6,000. This, quite frankly, blew my mind. 

Anyway, being the kind of dork that I am, I immediately decided to take this dataset and wrap a website around it. About two hours later, I had a fully functioning [guide to local farmers markets](http://www.yourfarmersmarkets.com), and even a halfway decent domain name to go with it. Hopefully, it'll be useful to someone!
