Newsweek had a number of reporters embedded in the McCain, Obama and Clinton campaigns for the past year, working on <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/167581">a multi-part inside story on what happened over the past year</a>. Part 4 of 7 was posted this morning, and it's well worth the time to read it. Here's one of my favorite highlights from Part 4:
<blockquote>At the end of August, as Hurricane Gustav threatened the coast of Texas, the Obama campaign called the Red Cross to say it would be routing donations to it via the Red Cross home page. Get your servers readyâ€”our guys can be pretty nuts, Team Obama said. Sure, sure, whatever, the Red Cross responded. We've been through 9/11, Katrina, we can handle it. The surge of Obama dollars crashed the Red Cross Web site in less than 15 minutes.</blockquote>
