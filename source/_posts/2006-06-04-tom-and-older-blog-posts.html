  Also, I discovered all of my original blog posts still stored in an old database of mine here on brethorsting. They were an unfortunate casulty of my migration to Movable Type 3 a while back. Anyway, you'll find them in the archive list; just start with the oldest entries. It was interesting reading back over them; they were written in the Summer and Fall of 2003, when I was graduating from college, bored with Honeywell, and finishing iRooster 1.0.
