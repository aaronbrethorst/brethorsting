I have almost finished iRooster 2.0.1. As the name implies, it's just a couple bug fixes. However, I have tossed in one extra thing. Now, if and when iRooster crashes, you will be able to send crash report information to me instead of Apple. I don't collect anything that is potentially comprimising. In fact, I'll post a sample error log just so you can see what it looks like. This information is invaluable to me since it allows me to actually figure out when and where iRooster crashes in real-world circumstances. This sort of work great improves the overall quality of my product over time.
