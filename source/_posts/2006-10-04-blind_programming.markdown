Want to know how blind developers really work? Ask them. <a href="http://www.blindprogramming.com/">Sign up for the Blind Programming mailing list</a>. Although I certainly do not speak for that community, the people I've spoken to have always appreciated knowing that the people creating developer tools are trying to make their experience better, and they certainly know better than anyone else just how accessible your software really is.
