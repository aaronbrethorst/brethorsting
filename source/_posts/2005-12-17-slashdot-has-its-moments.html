Every now and then, <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=171402&cid=14274177">someone on Slashdot actually does say something useful</a>:

  <em>I personally look forward to the day when the GOP has something to do with, you know, conservatism again. "Spend responsibly" rolls off the tounge better than "constant wanton abuse of power". Still, at least it was just violation of the basic agreement that forms the basis of our government and not, you know, a blowjob. Otherwise the nation might have to sit through another impeachment.</em>
