Tom Barta, slayer of dragons, commenter with much to say, and all-around devilishly handsome chap <a href="http://tombarta.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/microsofts-startup-company-simulation/">had the following to say about me</a>:

  <img border="1" width="325" src="http://www.popfly.ms/Overview/images/team/group.jpg" alt="Popfly team picture" height="189" style="width: 325px; height: 189px" />
  <blockquote>This one looks the most realistic. Notice the token Startup Guy and Girl Programmer hidden among a flock of token Fortune 500 Boring Guys, like a game of Where’s Waldo.</blockquote>
  Yes, that's right! I am the Token Startup Guy! :)

  In our defense, though, regarding the human pyramid picture: this was one of those things that our managers (who are not in the pyramid, but are instead sitting in front of it) decided was a Really Bad Idea potentially fraught with maiming and back pain. They tried to talk us out of it, but the hotter heads prevailed.

  Also, regarding the makeup of our team: the term Program Manager is a bit deceptive. I've taken the liberty of annotating our team members' roles so that this all makes a bit more sense:
  <table>
