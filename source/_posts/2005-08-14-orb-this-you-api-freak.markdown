Two cool things:
  1. <a href="http://www.orb.com/">Orb</a>just released a fairly basic API set for their software, which allows you to stream media off your home PC to any connected device anywhere in the world. ooh ooh ooh. I like being able to extend existing services :-)

  2. Looks like they have a Mac version coming out this year.

  Fan-fucking-tastic. I think it sucks that iRooster can only access media on the Macintosh it's running on. Hopefully I'll be able to fix this.
