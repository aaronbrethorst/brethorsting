A while back my dev lead, Paul, pointed out to me that all of the new signage going up inside of Microsoft was printed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe">Segoe, the new Windows Vista font</a>. I might not have ever noticed this had he not pointed it out. Naturally, when I heard about <a href="http://www.helveticafilm.com/">Helvetica</a>, the new independent film celebrating the font (seriously), I thought of him.
  <blockquote>Helvetica is a feature-length independent film about typography, graphic design and global visual culture. It looks at the proliferation of one typeface (which will celebrate its 50th birthday in 2007) as part of a larger conversation about the way type affects our lives. Helvetica will begin screening at film festivals worldwide starting in early 2007.</blockquote>

  And yes, I will go to see this when it comes out :-)
