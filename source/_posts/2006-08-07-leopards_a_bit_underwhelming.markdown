Apple's yearly bring-out-the-faithful shindig, WWDC, kicked off this morning with Steve Jobs's keynote. I read through <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/07/apple-os-x-10-5-leopard-officially-debuts">the coverage at engadget</a>, and I must say that I am distinctly underwhelmed. Sure, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">dual-proc Mac Pro</a> is a lusty piece of hardware, but everyone expected that.

  Otherwise, what was there?

  <em>64-bit Cocoa and Carbon application support.</em> - OK... I feel like I've seen all of this before, on Windows.

  <em>Time Machine</em> - So it has file backup with nifty visualizations built in.

  <em>Boot Camp</em> - Cool, I hope it works well with Vista.

  <em>Photo Booth</em> - Huh?

  <em>Spaces</em> - a.k.a virtual desktops. Yawn.

  <em>Spotlight</em> - Searches across networks now, and has a few other features. I'm not particularly blown away here, either.

  <em>Core Animation</em> - This is definitely cool, but it still frustrates me to no end that I need to build an application that is wholly dependent on Leopard for it. Microsoft is supporting XP with WPF because our customers demanded it.

  <em>Universal Access</em> - Sweet, good to hear that Apple's improving their accessibility support. I've spoken with a couple blind developers who were less than impressed with VoiceOver in Tiger. I'd love to see OS X become more accessible to everyone.

  <em>Mail</em> - Meh. I hate Mail.app on Tiger so much that I've gone back to using Pine. Hopefully it'll get better.

  <em>Dashboard</em> - Nice to see that Apple will provide tooling around creating Dashboard Widgets. I hate the whole Widgety thing, though. I've never found those features compelling enough to use on a long-term basis.

  <em>iChat</em> - New, sorely needed features, but I'll probably stick to AdiumX, which allows me to use AIM alongside the Live Messenger service.

  <em>Enhanced Parental Controls</em> - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/forhome/safety.mspx">::cough-cough::</a>

  Xcode 3 - Now this intrigues. Immensely. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/xcode.html">Apple's teaser page</a> talks about Objective-C 2.0, which apparently includes Garbage Collection (finally). Interface Builder is apparently getting a sizable, much-needed overhaul. Plus, Apple's introducing more debugger visualization features into the IDE (finally!). As much as I enjoy <a href="http://www.chimpsoftware.com">developing Mac applications</a>, the painfully decrepit nature of the Xcode debugger has always frustrated me, coming from a Visual Studio background. Try spending just 20 minutes working with the VS debugger; it'll change the way you think about debugging code. Seriously.

  Apparently, Apple has a few undisclosed features that they didn't want to trot out yet, since they didn't want to give a certain company "time to start their photocopiers." So, maybe Leopard won't be a complete letdown. I know I'll buy a copy next Spring when it comes out, but that doesn't mean I'll enjoy plunking down $130 for it.

  Update: <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/08/im-sorry-about-apple-hype/">Robert Scoble issues a lame-o mea culpa</a> on his Cringely-esque prognostications.
