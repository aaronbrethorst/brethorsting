Business Week's next issue has an article exploring <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_39/b4002414.htm">Jonathan Ive's backstory, what he does, and what makes him tick</a>. A fascinating exploration into the "man behind the curtain" at Apple.

  <blockquote>Ive invests his design dollars in state-of-the-art prototyping equipment, not large numbers of people. And his design process revolves around intense iteration -- making and remaking models to visualize new concepts. "One of the hallmarks of the team I think is this sense of looking to be wrong," said Ive at Radical Craft. "It's the inquisitiveness, the sense of exploration. It's about being excited to be wrong because then you've discovered something new."</blockquote>
