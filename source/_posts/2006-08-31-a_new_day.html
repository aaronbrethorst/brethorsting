The single most beautiful thing I have ever borne witness to was a <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.is/">Sigur Ros</a> concert in Seattle back in May 2006. There's a point in one of their songs, entitled vi&eth;rar vel til loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa, where the lead singer, J&oacute;nsi, pauses mid-lyric, holding his breath, as the audience waits with a sense of rapt attention that I only wish I could hold over you, my gentle reader.

  You can get a sense of the sheer beauty of this moment through a stream of an Icelandic show from 2005, which has been <a href="http://exodus.interoutemediaservices.com/?id=5e0bed71-1689-4322-b3af-6b4b51b134d3&delivery=stream">handily archived for your viewing pleasure</a>. Watch the whole thing, or scrub forward to 1:11:30.

  Someone far more poetic than I could ever hope to be <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/tour/2005/20051127.php">described this moment thusly</a>:
  <blockquote>[T]he climax of the concert occurred in "vi&eth;rar vel til loft&aacute;r&aacute;sa". i have already mentioned the long silence before the line "vi&eth; ri&eth;um heimsendi". though this was particularly sweet, nothing could have prepared me for the flood of emotions that came upon hearing j&oacute;nsi singing the line "the best thing god has created is a new day". in one instant all the memories of my life appeared to me, just as is said to happen when we die. i saw a white light which was not of this world...[and] a tear fell down my right cheek and i had to tighten the grip on my significant other, sitting to my right. The person sitting to my left ran off shortly after this song and didn't come back. i imagine the song touched him so deeply that he realized he had made a mistake and decided to run down the stairs, into the embrace of his loved one. just like in the movies. except it's real.</blockquote>

  <em>The best thing God has created is a new day</em>. Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindi, Shinto, Agnostic, or what have you; there is still something deeply moving in these words.
