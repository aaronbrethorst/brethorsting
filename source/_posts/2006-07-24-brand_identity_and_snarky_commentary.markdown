I just stumbled across the <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/">Identityworks</a> website, <a href="http://www.digg.com/design/The_Best_Logo_Redesigns_of_2006">by way of Digg</a>. Although I've never seen Identityworks before, it's rapidly becoming a new favorite. Dating all the way back 1998, the site catalogues brand and logo changes from across the Fortune 1000, and seems to be the brainchild of <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/spaeth/index.htm">Tony Spaeth</a>, notable identity consultant.

  Some of my personal favorites on Identityworks include:

  <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/reviews/2003/gateway.htm">Gateway's 2003 Logo Redesign</a>: <blockquote>First Impressions: The brand is simply out of control.</blockquote>

  <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/reviews/2003/ups.htm">UPS's Uber-Brand Shift</a>: <blockquote>Paul Rand's 1961 design was strikingly inappropriate for a global shipper. UPS notes that for several decades, they've rejected packages with strings, which snag the sorting machines.</blockquote>

  <a href="http://www.identityworks.com/reviews/1998/pwc.htm">Regarding PriceWaterhouseCoopers</a>: <blockquote>ToolongbyFar and clearly, not well considered...And what is a designer to do with a name like this? Interbrand found its solution in the playfulness of 18th century typography, and threw in a dated monogram for good measure.</blockquote>
