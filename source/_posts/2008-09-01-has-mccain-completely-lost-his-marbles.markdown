All signs seem to indicate that the answer is 'yes.' I mean, c'mon, did his people vet Sarah Palin? Even a little? She's been his running mate for all of half a week, and three scandals involving her have already come to light. What. The. Fuck.

<a href="http://mudflats.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/sarah-palins-vetting-problem">Here's a good summary of the way I'm feeling</a>:
<blockquote>And if it’s true that Palin did not undergo a vetting process, then what are we all to think of a presidential candidate, the oldest ever, with a history of cancer, choosing a running mate he had spoken to only once before offering her the nomination, and not even vetting this candidate?  If this is true, then the choice was not ‘bold’ or ‘exciting’ or ‘a maverick choosing a maverick’.  It demonstrates not just poor judgement, but recklessness.</blockquote>
