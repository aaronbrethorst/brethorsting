The following is a list of things I still want to acquire for my apartment. This list exists for me, in order to allow me to easily track this stuff:

  - Mirrors for behind couch
  - Espresso-finished ottoman
  - Media cabinet
  - TV stand
  - Speaker stands
  - rug for bathroom
  - small stand for violin lamp (2 ft high?)
  - other various and sundry lamps
