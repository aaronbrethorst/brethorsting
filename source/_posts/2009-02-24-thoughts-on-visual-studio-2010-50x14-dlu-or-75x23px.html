<a href="http://brethorsting.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/extension_manager.png"><img src="http://brethorsting.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/extension_manager-300x212.png" alt="extension_manager" title="extension_manager" width="300" height="212" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1146" /></a>

I just saw some screen shots of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonz/archive/2009/02/20/a-new-look-for-visual-studio-2010.aspx">the new Visual Studio 2010 shell</a> from Jason Zander, the GM of Visual Studio. By and large, it looks good, although my hunch is that the first two screenshots included in the blog post are actually mockups.

That said, what on earth is up with the buttons in the Extension Manager? A proper Windows button should be sized at 50x14DLU if it's implemented in native code, and 75x23px if implemented in managed code. These buttons are simply HUMONGOUS. Good lord!

<em>In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I was one of the people responsible for the look and feel of Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.</em>
