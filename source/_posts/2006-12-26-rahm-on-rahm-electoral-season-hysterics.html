<a href="http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_5251">GQ has an article about Rahm Emmanuel</a>, Illinois Congressman and one of the architects of the Democratic Party's November triumph, and the state of histrionics the party elite found itself in during the waning weeks of the campaign:
<blockquote>Rahm delivers a tongue-lashing [to Adam Nagourney, Chief Political Correspondent for the NYT] unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever heard from a United States congressman..."Do you know one voter in America who votes because Washington has a conversation with itself? Nobody gives a fuck what Washington has to say, including me."</blockquote>
