Yeah, it's been a week since I last posted; I've been busy, dead-tired, and generally unwilling to expend the energy to reach out and touch all four of my loyal readers on this blog-thing. Work's been kicking my ass of late. We're winding down our current project milestone, which means that my 'real' work for our project is just beginning. I've been mired in presentation-purgatory for the past few months, and I have another one to give to a fairly high-up person on Friday, for which I'm currently procrastinating.

  I've felt incredibly worn down for the past few weeks now, which has started worrying me. I'm sure I'll bounce back before too terribly long here. I feel like I need a change of pace in the office, and, hopefully, I'll get just that with the impending milestone. The big things I've been aching to do lately are to read a book, learn more about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a>, finish iRooster v2.2, and experiment with a number of UI ideas I have for developer tools platforms. Unfortunately, I don't feel like I've been able to do any of those. Maybe I'll take some time off (like a long weekend here or there). I have three weeks of vacation time saved up, and it's burning a hole in my calendar.

  Perhaps that's my issue (tangentially, don't you just love wading through my stream of consciousness babble, especially when I actually figure shit out about my life? :-P). I've had so much trouble seeing an effective end to any of the projects I've been working on. They have had poorly defined end goals and end dates, and it's been challenging to see definitive progress made on them as a result. And, to compound issues, I haven't taken a real weekend off in quite a while. Sigh.

  It also doesn't help that it's been <a href="http://www.komotv.com/stories/41315.htm">raining for a whole fucking month now</a>. That wears on you a bit, too.

  On a more personal note (something I usually avoid here, as I'm sure you, gentle reader, have noticed), Jamie's no longer talking to me. Yet again. We'll see what happens there, although I must say I'm happy about her choice here; it's exactly what I wanted and she wouldn't accept. I haven't spoken to Anne in upwards of three weeks now (for which I feel like a complete dick).

  Helen's currently asleep in my bed. We watched the season premiere of 24 (Day 5) tonight. We'd do it at her place, but she owns no TV at present. She is planning on ordering an LCD HDTV, but has been playing a waiting game now that CES has come and showed us all sorts of nice little goodies shipping over the next few months. I'm in the same boat. I refuse to buy an HDTV before two things occur:
  1) I can get an HDTV tuner for my media center.
  2) Snazzy new HDTV models are released into the world.

  Maybe I'll break down and order one before those critieria are met. Maybe not.

  On a weirder note, Helen went to a show on Saturday at the <a href="http://tractortavern.citysearch.com/">Tractor Tavern</a> in Ballard. It turned out that one of Anne's friend's bands was playing there that night. Seattle, despite being the size of Minneapolis and St. Paul combined, always seems small to me; you never know who you might run into, but you can guarantee yourself some odd event like that.

  Meanwhile, I spent Saturday night with Rachel, a friend from University who just moved out here. We haven't seen each other in the better part of two years, but had no trouble picking up right where we left off. It's always strange when you find yourself able to do that. I enjoy it, though, and I'm really looking forward to having her around. We hit up the <a href="http://www.stumblinggoatbistro.com/">Stumbling Goat Bistro</a> (have their risotto, i usually do). Following dinner, we found ourselves at a Fiasco show at the Owl n' Thistle. A good time, I believe, was had by all.
