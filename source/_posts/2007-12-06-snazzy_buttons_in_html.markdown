I discovered <a href="http://www.oscaralexander.com/tutorials/how-to-make-sexy-buttons-with-css.html">Oscar Alexander's tutorial on snazzy HTML rounded buttons</a> a while back, but needed it for something just a minute ago. It's a fantastically easy way to create really attractive link buttons without much work and without using Javascript. Of course, you'll need to clutter up your DOM with an extra span. This might not bother you (it doesn't for me), but if it does you can always tie this in with Prototype to perform an element insertion at <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2007/12/domloaded_makes_me_happy.html">dom:ready</a> or pageload.
