<a href="http://www.reverb10.com/december-4-wonder/">December 4 – Wonder</a>.  How did you cultivate a sense of wonder in your life this year?

In the sense of:
<div id="_mcePaste">wonder |ˈwəndər|</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">noun</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">a feeling of surprise mingled with admiration, caused by something beautiful, unexpected, unfamiliar, or inexplicable : <em>he had stood in front of it, observing the intricacy of the ironwork with the wonder of a child.</em></div>
By creating a thriving, healthy, incredibly successful contracting and consulting business from literally nothing. Like, nothing in the sense that I hadn't received a paycheck in months, and was starting to consider going back to blue-badge life nothing.
