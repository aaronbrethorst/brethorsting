This has been a pretty damned good week for me:

  - Four day weekend.
  - My birthday is on Sunday (22, in case you were curious).
  - New car tomorrow.
  - Massage tomorrow at four.
  - Finally done with performance reviews.
  - Visual Studio 2005 Beta 1 finally fucking shipped.
  - (Count em, ) two releases of iRooster this week.
  - I'm now down to $3500 in credit card debt (let's ignore the fact that I pay $19k for a car tomorrow, eh?).
  - Summertime in Seattle is absolutely beautiful (let's not forget that).

  Woo-hoo! All around, life is going quite well for me.
