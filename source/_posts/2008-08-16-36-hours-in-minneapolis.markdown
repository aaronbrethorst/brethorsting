The NYT has <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/travel/17hours.html">a travel article up today</a> about the sights and sounds of Minneapolis and St. Paul. All good advice, with a highlight:
<blockquote>Tell room service to keep it quiet when they deliver coffee. Or if you are feeling ambitious, go to Al’s Breakfast in Dinkytown (413 14th Avenue SE; 612-331-9991), hard by the east bank campus of the University of Minnesota. Wait against the wall for one of 14 stools, while eyeing the food of the patron whose stool you are coveting. Minnesota is a friendly place, but don’t ask for a bite of his blueberry pancakes.</blockquote>
I have never waited longer for greasier food, nor loved the whole thing more than at Al's Breakfast.
