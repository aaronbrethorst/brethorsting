From John Udell <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/04/30/a-conversation-with-john-lam-about-the-dynamic-language-runtime-silverlight-and-ruby/">regarding our announcements yesterday morning</a>: <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'"><em>“Look, I’ve got IronPython using ActiveRecord and LINQ, all inside the Safari browser on my Mac, and I’m debugging it in Visual Studio remotely from my PC.” These kinds of scenarios are in fact becoming possible, and those of us who appreciate all of these components individually will rightly pronounce it cool that they can come together in these ways. </em></span>

  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'">Anyway, I'm at Mix right now, hopelessly tired and terribly underslept. I'll be talking more before too long, I suspect. I've just been deeply embargoed for quite a while now. This stuff is simply awesome, though. No other way to describe it.</span>
