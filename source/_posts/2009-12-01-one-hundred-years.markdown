<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/world/asia/02prexy.html?hp=&pagewanted=all">Captain Blinky has decided to express an opinion about the conflict in Afghanistan</a>. Does anyone know if he ever compensated the US government for all the planes he crashed back in the day?

<blockquote>Hours before the speech, Senator John McCain of Arizona expressed support for sending more troops to Afghanistan but said he opposed a timetable. "Dates for withdrawal are dictated by conditions," Mr. McCain, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill. "The way that you win wars is to break the enemyâ€™s will, not to announce dates that you are leaving."</blockquote>

McCain makes a great point here, considering how well this strategy worked for the US in the Vietnam War. Can you imagine where we'd be right now if he'd won last November? Horrifying thought.
