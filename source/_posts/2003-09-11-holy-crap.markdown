It never rains, it pours.

  iRooster appears to have been a featured download on apple.com today. I had several thousand downloads and as many purchases today as I did all last month.

  I ordered an ibook from smalldog. It is a stopgap until aluminum 15 inch pbooks come out, and I can afford one.

  More developments came today in jobland. I don't want to say more now, but hopefully Monday will bring good things.

  I am typing this entry in on my hiptop. This sucks. A lot. I need my iBook like yesterday. Instead, I am without OS X until Monday. Oh well, like I said, monday will hopefully bring good things in many shapes and sizes....
