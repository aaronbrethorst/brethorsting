The new Gorillaz album, Demon Days, is coming out in May. Yes, <strong>next month</strong>. It's only been 4 years since the last one came out.

  You can get streams of the first single from the <a href="http://fans.gorillaz.com/news.php">Gorillaz website</a>, or reposted below:
  <a href="http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/virg001/gorillaz/video/demon_days/gorillaz_feel_good_inc_hi.asx?siteid=fansite">Audio (WMA)</a>
  <a href="http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/virg001/gorillaz/video/demon_days/gorillaz_feel_good_inc_hi.asx?siteid=fansite">Video</a>

  There's also lo-fi WMA streams and Real Media streams, but I don't link to that shit.

  Cheers :)
