My friend Rob forwarded me a link to an interview on AIGA about <a href="http://designforum.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentAlias=_getfullarticle&aid=1406790">Aleksandar Macasev's Joseph Goebbels Project</a>:
  <blockquote>I am not trying to [create a hero out Goebbels by elevating Goebbels as an icon of information and disinformation], but part of the point is that I can create a heroic icon out of a villain, by using the power of an iconic advertising image...To paraphrase Goebbels, “A message repeated a thousand times becomes the truth.” Which means that everything and nothing is truth. Ergo–there is no truth.</blockquote>

  This strikes me as more than a little creepy, but it's an interesting take on the power of media and disinformation in modern society.
