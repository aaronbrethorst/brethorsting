The one thing I fear above all else is that someday I will have children. No wait. I'm not actually afraid of that. What I really fear is that someday these sweet, innocent, wonderful little people will become teenagers. That's what I'm really afraid of. So, whenever I hear about useful tips for behavior management of teenagers I make a point of remembering it. Take, for example, this eBay auction: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=62054&item=8107675670&rd=1">Selling Son's Beloved Playstation 2 for Punishment</a>.
