<em>Update: claimed by Boris.</em>

Shot at Discovery Park today. Did about 650 pictures, ended up really liking about 80 of them. Still, I whittled those down to 15. Posted them up on Flickr just a little while ago, added them to my SmugMug gallery, slapped them up on Facebook, and submitted to Photoshelter. Jiminy Cricket!

Anyway, I had fun last time around with offering up a free 12x18 print to the first person who names their request in the comments below, or emails me, and I'm going to do it again. For now, though, the rules stipulate you can only win once (Wes).

To recap: leave a comment or email me telling me which photo you want a signed print of. I will have a 12x18" print created for you, which will be mailed to you free of charge. Even if you're in New Zealand (although I may reconsider the geography part).

If you don't win, you can always acquire <a href="http://photos.brethorsting.com/">open edition prints of these pictures on my Photo Gallery site</a>, hosted by SmugMug. If you want to see the full set, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157606917067682/">check it out on Flickr</a>.
