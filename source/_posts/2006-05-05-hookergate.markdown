How can you not love a scandal with this name? Porter Goss, the <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/multimedia/v/portergoss.htm">unqualified</a> CIA director, resigned unexpectedly today in events that appear linked to the <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/000481.php">Duke Cunningham bribery and hooker scandal</a>. Party of morals and family values indeed.
