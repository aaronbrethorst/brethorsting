I seem to have an action-packed Fall lined up for concerts and shows. Over the next couple months I'm going to see:
  <ul>
  	<li>Arcade Fire with LCD Soundsystem - September 24</li>
  	<li>Interpol - October 18</li>
  	<li>Spamalot - sometime in October</li>
  	<li>Decemberists - Dec 8</li>
  </ul>
  I'm excited, to be sure.
