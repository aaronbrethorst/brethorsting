I was in Japan last week. Great trip, lots of fun, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157604531936538/">took tons of pictures</a>, and more pictures are still to come on Flickr. Here's one to tide you over for the moment:

  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/2413007629/" title="Chiba City Blues by aaronbrethorst, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2190/2413007629_cde8dfb63c.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="Chiba City Blues" /></a>

  Also, my employer, Skytap, came out of stealth two weeks ago with the announcement of our first product: <a href="http://skytap.com/skytap-virtual-lab">Skytap Virtual Lab</a>. More on this soon.
