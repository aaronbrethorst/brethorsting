The New York Times has an interactive map up today detailing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/06/08/travel/20080608_BALLPARK_GRAPHIC.html">the best and worst food from ballparks across the country</a>.Â 

My personal favorite description is for the ever-unloved Chisox and their tepidly named U.S. Cellular Field: "What to order: nothing. Your best bet is to bring a six-pack to the parking lot, and barter a cold one for a tailgater's hot dog. Failing that, a box of Cracker Jack. What to avoid: everything."

Update: I just realized that there is actually a fairly lengthy discourse published alongside the infoporn referenced above with a far more clever name than the one I ginned up: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/travel/08baseball.html">Buy Me Some Sushi and Baby Back Ribs</a>.
