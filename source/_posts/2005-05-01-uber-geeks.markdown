Ah, the good kids at MIT are at it again. There's going to be a time travelers' conference on May 7th. Specifically, it will be at:

  May 7, 2005, 10:00pm EDT
  (08 May 2005 02:00:00 UTC)

  East Campus Courtyard, MIT
  42:21:36.025°N, 71:05:16.332°W
  (42.360007,-071.087870 in decimal degrees)

  The guy who brainstormed this is asking for snack/drink funding through Paypal, and as much publicity for the event as can be mustered. I find this whole thing amusing in a sad sort of way, although there is something appealing about the whole affair.

  To be pedantic about it, though, assuming that no time travelers actually show up (my money's on NO), it's impossible to say that it is hard proof time travel is physically impossible.

  Anyway, to see more on this, check out the official <a href="http://web.mit.edu/adorai/timetraveler/">Time Traveler Convention website</a>.
