I fixed one more little bug in Lullabye earlier today. It would prevent alarms from working after Lullabye had been used. The problem that caused it was that iTunes would not quit before the computer went to sleep, which would cause some issues with iRooster upon wake-up. I feel that I'm almost ready to release iRooster 2.1, and I'll probably do it later today or tomorrow morning. I'm excited, it's taken me about three months to get here, and I'm very happy to have this particular project almost finished.
