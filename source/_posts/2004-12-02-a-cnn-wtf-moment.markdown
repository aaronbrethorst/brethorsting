This was the CNN QuickPoll thing the night of Thursday, 2 December 2004. And the only thing I can even think to say is "what the fuck!?" This is utterly bizarre, and far below what I'd expect of CNN.

  The only thing I can even think of is that whatever editorial board puts this thing together decided to defer to their teenage daughters for today. Weird.
