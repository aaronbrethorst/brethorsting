Found through <a href="http://www.BrandChannel.com">BrandChannel.com</a> (of course):
  Interbrand in association with Business Week published a report on <a href="http://www.ourfishbowl.com/images/surveys/BGB06Report_072706.pdf">the best brands of 2006</a> (watch out, it's a PDF). Topping the charts, not surprisingly, was Coca-Cola. What did surprise me, though, was the brand value disparity between Microsoft (#2) and Apple (#39).

  Regarding the beverage industry:
  <blockquote>Broadening of the category and the myriad of options for beverages are the industryâ€™s greatest hope and its greatest threat. A proliferation of product represents choice but also communicates confusion and potentially lower margins given the cost of specialty drink runs versus the mass appeal of signature products.</blockquote>
