The talented Josh Pigford from the <a href="http://www.theappleblog.com">The Apple Blog</a> just posted his <a href="http://www.theappleblog.com/2005/03/10/irooster-turn-your-mac-into-a-2000-alarm-clock">review of iRooster</a> today: <em>iRooster is one of those apps that makes you say “Ahh…now THIS is why I own a Mac.” It’s just so practical. I look forward to what this program could evolve into over time.</em>

  As you can see from that review, iRooster just gained a new icon last night. I had been intending to introduce it in 2.1.1, but the review seemed like the perfect opportunity.

  Terrible apologies for my lack of writing in here, but I'm sure the four people who read this on a regular basis understand what has been occupying my time lately (work, ack!).
