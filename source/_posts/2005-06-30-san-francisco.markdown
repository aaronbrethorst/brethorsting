I'm flying down to San Francisco tomorrow for a nice, long relaxing weekend (Friday afternoon to Tuesday morning). Napa, fireworks, my birthday, Helen, how could it possibly be better? ;-)

  My boss, Jason, burst into my office this afternoon asking me if I could hit IKEA with him to buy what would work out to be about $300 worth of picture frames. I've been selected, by him, to put together a poster series of sorts for our floor. It serves a legitimate business purpose, and I'm the unlucky one due to my semi-tolerable Photoshop skills.

  He was horribly disappointed when I reminded him that I was leaving town, and that-more importantly-he'd been perfectly happy to let me go at the time when he didn't foresee a pressing desire for nearly a dozen gigantic black frames.
