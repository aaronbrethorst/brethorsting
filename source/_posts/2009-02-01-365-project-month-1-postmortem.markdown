I started <a href="http://photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day/">a 365 photo project</a> on the first day of January. Perhaps not the best day, as I was nursing a mean hangover, but I'd still managed to shoot a portrait in the wee hours of that morning that I thought had some redeeming value to it.

Subsequently, I've shot hundreds of photos and saved what I think are the 31 best best for inclusion in some sort of arbitrary record of my growth as a photographer. And grow I think I have. I'd like to say that I really have noticed a distinct uptick in my ability to produce tolerable photos over the past few weeks. Hopefully, this will continue throughout the next 11 months, and I will enter 2010 with a portfolio that doesn't suck.
