<em>What’s the thing you most want to achieve next year? How do you imagine you’ll feel when you get it? Free? Happy? Complete? Blissful? Write that feeling down. Then, brainstorm 10 things you can do, or 10 new thoughts you can think, in order to experience that feeling today.</em>

A sense of happy blissfulness: happy blissfulness. Brainstorm? No. Not gonna happen.
