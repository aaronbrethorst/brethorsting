I am ready to sign off on iRooster 1.2 Beta 1. I've done a lot of work to firm it up, make it as usable as possible, and add cool new features to it. I implemented a feature in an hour last night that allows users to check for updates and see if they're running the latest version. It's pretty cool stuff, I think!

  I will be sending an email to all registered users either Wednesday the 1st or Thursday the 2nd with download information. Hopefully, we won't see any major new bugs come in from this. More info soon...
