In just over a month my least favorite time of year, the holiday shopping frenzy, will begin in earnest. On the 12th, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/Oct06/10-1290NewProductsPR.mspx">Microsoft announced that</a> "More than 250 hardware and software products from over 50 industry partners have received either the Certified for Windows Vista logo or the Works with Windows Vista logo."

  Think about that for a second: 250 products specifically designed for Windows Vista out of an ecosystem of...50,000 products? Maybe more? There won't be a ton of software out there that really takes advantage of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/">the cool, new functionality in Vista</a> this winter, and it seems like a great opportunity to grab a disproportionate amount of the spotlight come this winter.

  That's my plan, at least. Are you building software specifically for Vista? Are you planning on shipping it this winter?
