On rare occasions, I will read something that is genuinely amusing on Slashdot. I just had one with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Smirnoff">Yakov Smirnoff</a>-esque joke, of sorts.

  <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=175041&cid=14554631">yobjob says</a>: "IN CAPITALIST AMERICA, WORK FINISHES YOU!" in response to a fairly involved thread about the IT industry and bringing your work home with you.

  Sigh. I clearly need to stop reading Slashdot.
