<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/hastily-composed/">150 years ago tomorrow, Jefferson Davis became the first and only President of the Confederate States of America</a>.
<blockquote>The address was most notable for what it left out: any attempt to explain how a nation could possibly remain viable, let alone democratic, if it were founded on the principle that any constituent part might withdraw as soon as it found itself in the minority on an important political issue.</blockquote>
