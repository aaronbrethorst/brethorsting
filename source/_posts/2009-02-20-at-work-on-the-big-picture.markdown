<a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html">The Big Picture</a> comes through again with a stunning collection of 45 photographs depicting people at work around the globe. Two pictures that stood out at me were the juxtaposition of the facilities at Hennessy and a Thai man creating a crocodile purse from a very dead, dyed blue crocodile.
