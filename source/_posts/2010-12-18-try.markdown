<em>What do you want to try next year? Is there something you wanted to try in 2010? What happened when you did / didn’t go for it?</em>

To quote Yoda, "do, or do not. There is no try." So what am I going to do? I'm going to keep launching a project a month. I'm going to exercise more, eat better, and sleep more. I'm going to follow more of Patrick McKenzie's SEO advice. I'm going to make 2011 the best year it can possibly be.
