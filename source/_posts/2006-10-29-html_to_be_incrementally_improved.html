Apparently, the W3C just isn't getting enough uptake on XHTML, because it's simply too hard to shove people in the right direction:
  <blockquote>The attempt to get the world to switch to XML, including quotes around attribute values and slashes in empty tags and namespaces all at once didn't work. The large HTML-generating public did not move, largely because the browsers didn't complain.</blockquote>

  As a result, <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166">the W3C will be making incremental improvements to good, old HTML for a while yet</a>. Thankfully, they're also planning on updating the HTML validator.
