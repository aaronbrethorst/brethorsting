I was browsing through this blog's profile on Technorati a few minutes ago when I noticed that someone (besides myself) had marked this as a favorite. Feeling pleased, I decided to see who it was: turns out that Tantek Ã‡elik, CTO of Technorati, W3C member, former Microsoft employee, and fellow invitee to various and sundry barbecues <a href="http://www.technorati.com/blogs/http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign?show=faves">added me to his favorites list</a>. I'm quite honored, I must say :)
