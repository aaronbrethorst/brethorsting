<a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000727.html">Drunkenbatman wrote a scathing review of the Meetro for OS X Alpha preview last December</a>. I read his complaints about it last year when it was first published, and it caused me to go give <a href="http://www.meetro.com/">their Windows version a shot</a>. I found that the Windows version was perfectly serviceable, although rather divergent from the <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/07/windows_ux_guidelines.html">Windows User Experience Guidelines</a>.

  Ultimately, db's review of Meetro reminded me of one very important point: Mac users hate applications that don't act or look like good Mac applications should. Here's a case in point:
  <blockquote>I want to flat-out strangle a few of the dialog boxes, as o.m.g. does Meetro love showing you dialog boxes.</blockquote>

  Windows, for better or worse, is all about dialog boxes. Dialogs, dialogs everywhere! A well-designed Mac application, on the other hand, eschews dialogs whenever possible, instead allowing the user to perform inline data modification. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/category/10923.aspx">Office 2007 is doing a fantastic job of moving away from this model through the Ribbon</a>, and hopefully we'll see this model move into more and more of Microsoft's applications over the next few years. Of course, there are a few caveats in applying the Ribbon to other applications, which I will explore soon.
