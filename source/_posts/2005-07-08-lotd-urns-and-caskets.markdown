Did you know that Costco is not only a top-tier wholesaler for goods like computers, office products, and pharmaceuticals, but also sells urns and caskets off their website? Neither did I until just now.

  <a href="http://www.costco.com/Common/CategoryMain.aspx?cat=20595">Costco's urns and caskets</a> features <em>The Mother Casket</em>, and <em>Kentucky Rose</em> among others.

  God, I love the Interweb.
