<a href="http://blogs.labo-dotnet.com/simon/archive/2006/09/12/11116.aspx">Simon on the (dot)Net released an awesome Vista utility</a> (with source code, might I add), which duplicates the functionality of Apple's Expose feature on OS X. It's still a bit rough around the edges, but it's an awesome example of what can be done with the DWM in Windows Vista.
