Dave Massy, a PM from the Internet Explorer team, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/09/01/735673.aspx">blogged about the revamp of the IE Developer Center on MSDN</a>:
  <blockquote>We've worked to make some of the essential links such as reference material easier to find and we will be promoting different content on the front page regularly making it well worth visiting on a regular basis or subscribing to the RSS feed.</blockquote>

  The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ie/">IE Dev Center</a> has a bunch of new, interesting content included in it, like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/IETechCol/cols/dnexpie/ie7_css_ZenTek.asp">a CSS Zen Garden-modeled example highlighting new CSS support in IE7</a>.

  Judging by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/archive/2006/08/28/729070.aspx">Josh Ledgard's thoughts from last week</a>, the new content on the Dev Center may prove useful.
