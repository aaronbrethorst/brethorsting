I get a lot of email everyday. And by a lot, I mean that it totals into the thousands of items*. Seriously. Much of this is addressed to various internal mailing lists to which I subscribe, such as an Xbox Discussion alias, or Visual Studio UI discussions. But, even then, I probably get a few hundred mails per day addressed directly to me.

  There are a few important rules of email ettiquette that, if observed, would decrease my incoming mail rate, and make my life far better. MSN Lifesyle for Men, of all things, <a href="http://men.msn.com/articlemh.aspx?cp-documentid=1379703&GT1==8883">describes these rules in explicit detail</a>:
  <blockquote>Some people think out loud on issues of moderate import for 300 e-mails. And I'm in on all of them, because some doofus copied me on e-mail number one. E-mail should be used to inform, to resolve an issue, to end a conversation, to pass along a job, or to get out of something minor, without the need for personal interaction.</blockquote>

  Study these rules. Live them. Love them. You'll make me (and your coworkers) much happier for it.

  * Despite its warts, Outlook is the best email application I have ever used. There is no way I could manage this glut of information with any other mail application. Period. Between the Search Folders and the new super-fast search mechanism, I'm actually able to stay on top of my mail. Whew.
