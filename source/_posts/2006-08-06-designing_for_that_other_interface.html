I, like many of you, spend most days thinking about how to put forth the most professional and attractive experience possible in my software. I used to think that as long as I could create high-quality, professional-looking software with a fantastic Ux, I'd never have to worry about the rest of it. Of course, this assumes you can find people willing to pay you to design high-quality, professional-looking software. If you look like a slob, with a little bit of last night's dinner stuck to your OSCon 2006 shirt, people may think less of you. <a href="http://men.style.com/fashion/trend_report/022306/marine">If you play the part of the GQ man</a>, you might be a bit better off.

  As with many things in life, the superficial counts. Whether it's an attractive new icon for your software, or a pair of <a href="http://www.7forallmankind.com/index2.htm">Seven jeans</a> to cover up your bony, geeky ass, appearance matters. You're more likely to get a girlfriend, or that new job.

  I sent a mail to the Microsoft Interns (ahem, <a href="http://www.internz.org/">Internz</a>) mailing list a month or two back to inform them of the just-started Nordstrom Semi-Annual Mens' Sale. I had picked up two pairs of Jeans (Diesels and Sevens, in case you're curious), a couple belts, and a new pair of shoes. I was thoroughly excited, and wanted to share this experience with a group fo people who I thought could benefit from dressing better. A number of male internz called shennanigans on me, complaining that I was perpetuating negative behaviors in everyone, and that $130 jeans aren't worth the price (actually, I think they are). Several girls, meanwhile, emailed me privately to inform me that I now had a fan-club, and 'would you please talk to our boyfriends and see if you can get them to dress better?'

  <a href="http://www.urbanmonarch.com/fashion-for-geeks-why-bother">Glenn at Urban Monarch</a> talks about improving your sense of fashion in the context of getting yourself a girlfriend, but it's an important thing to consider, regardless of your end goal. Whether you want that new job, or that new hottie in <a href="http://onestop2.umn.edu/courses/tc/courses.jsp?designator=PHYS&submit=Show+the+courses">Quantum Mechanics</a>, dressing better is a great place to start.

  <blockquote>The subculture of geeks and nerds is filled with <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/66795671.html">great guys</a> who deserve cute, fun girlfriends &#8212; and not having simple fashion basics is a huge roadblock to that.</blockquote>
