Hi there - I am composing this on Thursday, October 12 around 11:30PM Pacific time, in Seattle. At the time this message is published, I will be touching down in Athens, Greece. It will about 9:50 AM in Athens, and I'll probably be stumbling around like a drunk, trying to figure out where I am and what time it is.

  I've prepped a few blog entires for the week, but they will be relatively sporadic (unless I find time over Friday to prepare a few more to round out the schedule). Take care, and have a fantastic week! Brethorsting UI Design should be back on a normal publishing schedule on October 24th or 25th.
