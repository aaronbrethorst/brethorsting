A few questions regarding <a href="http://jesus-withyoualways.com/ImagesJun06/clown.jpg">this linked image</a>Â from <a href="http://jesus-withyoualways.com/">jesus-withyoualways.com</a>.
<ul>
	<li>why does Jesus have a nasty little pencil moustache?</li>
	<li>why does this girl look like some sort of slug monster?</li>
	<li>why does Jesus look like he's offering this little slug monster baby to the clown?</li>
	<li>It kind of goes without saying that it looks like the clown wants to devour her considering that's what clowns do, but it still creeps me out.</li>
</ul>
