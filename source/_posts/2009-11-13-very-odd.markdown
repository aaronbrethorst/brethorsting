<blockquote>Maybe Levi Johnson really does have a dark secret about Sarah Palin that she doesn't want revealed.

Though Palin's new memoir takes shots at many people -- and "describes heart-wrenching anguish about her teen daughter's pregnancy playing out before a national audience" -- WCBS-TV notes "the 413-page tome doesn't contain a single reference to the father of her granddaughter, soon-to-be Playgirl model Levi Johnston."</blockquote>
