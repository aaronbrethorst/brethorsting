From Tycho on <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> today: "Halo has those little grunts, and I guess I'm supposed to feel like a bad-ass when I destroy them but I actually just feel like an asshole. [They seem like they] just fell in with the wrong crowd. What they need are compelling after school activities, not death."
