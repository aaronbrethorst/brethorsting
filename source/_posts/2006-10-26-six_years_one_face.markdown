A guy I work with just forwarded this onto me. It's a bit outside the scope of "UI Design," but still interesting. Noah Kalina has taken pictures of himself everyday for the past six years, every one of which is <a href="http://everyday.noahkalina.com/">archived on his website</a> and also <a href="http://www.motionabbey.net/2006/09/a_selfportrait_everyday_for_6.html">in video form on Motion Abbey</a>.
