<p>Popfly Beta has launched! Anyone can now sign up for our awesome, easy-to-use mashup builder. <a href="http://www.popfly.com">Just head on over to our website</a>, click the sign in button, and create an account. We've been getting some rave reviews today, and <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/explainer/what-you-need-to-know-about-microsofts-popfly-312566.php">Valleywag is treating it better than their usual sense of disdain</a>, which I think is nigh on unprecedented ;-):</p>
  <blockquote>But Microsoft should, nevertheless, be excited about Popfly. Rarely has Redmond produced such a simple, visually appealing tool for developers.</blockquote>
