Emma Dobrescu, a multilingual Romanian web designer of some repute, <a href="http://www.thinkpinkstudio.com/wordpress/2006/10/10/proud-member-of-web-20-haters-club/">expressed her hatred for Web 2.0 on her blog yesterday</a>:
  <blockquote>I’ll tell you the truth, I’m not an AJAX hater, I don’t despise collaborative applications, I am all for the rich user experience. What I hate is gibberish talk.</blockquote>

  And she's absolutely right. Whether it's people taking Zeldman seriously when he starts <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/web3point0">a decidedly tongue-in-cheek Web 3.0 meme</a>, <a href="http://www.xmlfund.com/main.asp">or venture capitalists investing solely in XML-based projects</a> (<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/vc08.shtml">Seattle PI has more</a>, and oh the irony...the XML Fund website isn't composed of XHTML; heck it isn't even valid HTML 4.01!), you really gotta start wondering what's going on in some people's heads. Then again, Slashdot's built itself a pretty good business with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashbot#Slashbot">a readership renowned for its groupthink mentality</a>.

  So anyway, Emma, can I join your club?

  oh yeah, and in the interest of full disclosure, I readily admit that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">I drink that funky red, green, yellow and blue kool-aid</a> :-)
