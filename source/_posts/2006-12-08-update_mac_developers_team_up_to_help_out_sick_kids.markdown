On the sixth, I wrote that <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/12/mac_developers_team_up_to_help.html">all of my proceeds from iRooster on December 7th would be donated to Penny Arcade's Child's Play Charity to help out sick kids in children's hospitals</a>. The outpouring of generosity was <em>amazing!</em> I ended up collecting $200 yesterday that will be donated entirely to Child's Play! Thank you all very much for purchasing iRooster yesterday; your contribution means a lot to me, and will mean the world to kids who wouldn't have much to look forward to otherwise.

This was so successful, in fact, that I may end up doing this more often in the future. I hope that you will be kind enough to open up your heart and your wallet to other charitable organizations, again.

Thanks!
Aaron
