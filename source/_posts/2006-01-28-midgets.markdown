I'm sitting in a coffee shop a block away from my apartment finishing up some work before heading off to a party celebrating the 25th birthday of one of my designers when, without warning, a motorized wheelchair goes scooting past. Clinging to the back of the wheelchair is a midget. No one even bothers to gawk at this spectacle. I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to respond, but I can't imagine they see this sort of thing on a daily basis.

  weird. really weird.
