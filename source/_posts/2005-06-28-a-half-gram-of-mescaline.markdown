Hannibal of Ars Technica visited <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050626-5041.html">Wired Magazine's disappointing NextFest</a>: <i>I know if I were Japanese, I'd collect both models and watch them fight over a half gram of mescaline.</i>

  Oh yeah, and for the five people I haven't told yet, I'm off to Paris for five days in early July. Looks like it'll be a lot of fun :)
