<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/about.html">Kathy Sierra</a>, co-creator of the O'Reilly Head First book series (including the super-cool <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=sixdollarchim-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=%2Fexec%2Fobidos%2FASIN%2F0596007124">Head First Design Patterns</a> book), has a very long, very passionate post on some of the fundamental disconnects product creators have with their documentation.

  Kathy nails the fundamental issue right on its head:
  <blockquote>[Your average manual] suffers from one huge mother-of-an-assumption: that the user knows exactly what to look up!</blockquote>

  ...and goes on from there. Kathy's absolutely right: 99% of the time, I have no idea what the capabilities of a new product are, but I have a pretty good idea of what I want to accomplish. I might not have the slightest clue <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">that Javascript has first-class functions</a>. Even if I did know this, would I understand how this benefits me in a practical way? The best way to teach a lot of this stuff to a user is by presenting them with tasks, or a cookbook of sorts. "I want to..." tends to be a much better way of structuring content for a user than throwing them into the thick of <pre>public class Foo : Object</pre>

  Of course, <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/08/creating_inductive_user_interf.html">the inductive model does have its limits</a>, and a manual structured in this fashion can never take the place of something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=sixdollarchim-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=%2FC-Programming-Language-2nd%2Fdp%2F0131103628">K&amp;R</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=sixdollarchim-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=%2FStructure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering%2Fdp%2F0262011530">Wizard Book</a>, but it certainly has its place.
