Apparently Alan Keyes thinks Obama is a secret Commie, or something, trying to derail the United States. Wish I was joking. I also wish that:
<ol>
	<li>The LA Times would not print stupid things from an obviously insane man.</li>
	<li>Alan Keyes would just go away.</li>
</ol>

This whole thing, of course, ties back to the ludicrous birth certificate issue that was dredged up last year. God forbid Republicans would be willing to let this sort of thing go.

update: it seems that my buddy, Jerome, <a href="http://woodyblog.tumblr.com/post/80232191/white-ppl-alan-keys-is-crazy-stop-listening-to">agrees with me</a>.
