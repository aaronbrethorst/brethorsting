The turkey is finishing up in the oven, the pie is made, the mashed potatoes are ready. I'm drinking a beer...Which means it's clearly time to read TechMeme! My girlfriend (ok, she's really the one who's reading TechMeme, which is cool in its own right) noticed <a href="http://on10.net/Blogs/sarahintampa/a-harry-potter-like-clock-tracks-family-members/#comments">a post over on On10</a> about a &quot;clock&quot; vaguely like what <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/magic/devices/devices-t.html#timepieces">the Weasley family have on the wall of the Burrow in the Harry Potter books</a>.

  This is cool and all, but where's mortal peril?
