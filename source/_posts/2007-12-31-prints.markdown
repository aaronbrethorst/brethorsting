I've become something of a photography whore over the past few months. It started with a Digital SLR, and has moved to horribly expensive lenses, a burning desire to spend far too much money on lighting equipment, and an unholy fascination with framing everything I see.

  In any case, some of my friends and family believe that my photos are actually pretty decent and urged me to put a few of them up for sale. Want to buy a print? You can check them out in <a href="http://brethorsting.com/shop/main.php">my hastily constructed gallery</a>, and buy them directly from Digibug.
