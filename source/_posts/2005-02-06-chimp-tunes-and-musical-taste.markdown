One thing that Chimp Tunes has taught me is that not everyone listens to Top 40 drivel. Say, for example, like the person who listened to <em>Make it Big</em> by Wham!

  Let me be the first to say that I have no clue whatsoever about who these guys are, but I am proud to salute my 1980's hair overlords.

  The <a href=""http://www.sixdollarchimp.com/chimptunes">Chimp Tunes</a> website will still be officially in Beta for a while yet while I iron out a few more kinks, but <a href="http://www.sixdollarchimp.com/irooster.php">iRooster 2.1</a> is finished and will be released soon.

  Thank you, that is all.
