Slate has a list of tongue-in-cheek 'rumors' about Barack Obama up right now. Some of the highlights include:
<ul>
	<li> Barack Obama wears a FLAG PIN at all times. Even in the shower.</li>
	<li>There's only one artist on Barack Obama's iPod: FRANCIS SCOTT KEY.</li>
	<li>Barack Obama's skin is the color of AMERICAN SOIL.</li>
	<li>Barack Obama's new airplane includes a conference room, a kitchen, and a MEGACHURCH.</li>
	<li>[Barack Obama] travels mostly by FORKLIFT.</li>
</ul>

This reminds me of a number of other websites I've run across recently, of which my favorite is <a href="http://barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com/">Barack Obama is Your New Bicycle</a> (did you know that Barack Obama folded my laundry? He's such a nice guy).
