How can you not love this? <a href="http://www.hailxenu.net/">A group of disaffected, Internet-era youngsters</a> have pooled together $4000 to rent a plane that will fly over the site of M:I-3's Hollywood premiere. A banner reading "Hail Xenu LOL <3 OT" and "The Baby is Xenu's" will be attached to the plane.

  For those not in the loop, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenu">Xenu</a> is the evil alien overlord who, according to those wacky Scientologists, killed billions of people 75 million years ago. It just gets weirder from there. I highly recommend reading the aforementioned Wikipedia article.
