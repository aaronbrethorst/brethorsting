There was <a href="http://www.italiamac.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=46287">a thread on Italiamac</a> earlier this month about iRooster. Since it was entirely in Italian, and the amount of Italian I know at this point is barely enough to purchase a cappucino, I turned to the always reliable Babelfish.

  There is something of an inner beauty to the horribly mangled translations that it spits back at you, almost like an Woodie Allen movie...

  I found one that particularly delighted me: (apologies to Dan46)
  <blockquote>I am using rooster... wide awake me the morning with music. But he is to share... who has orecchie in order to mean means... ical not risveglia the mac from the state of stop, irooster yes!</blockquote>
