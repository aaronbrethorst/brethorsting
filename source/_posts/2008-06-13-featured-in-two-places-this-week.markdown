Two of my photos have been featured on websites this week. First, my picture Molten Sky was <a href="http://seattlest.com/2008/06/12/seattlest_pix_08jun12.php">a pick on Seattlest yesterday</a>. Second, my picture Eighth Wonder is being used <a href="http://www.schmap.com/northwest/attractions/#p=39963&amp;i=39963_18.jpg">on Schmap for Seattle's Smith Tower</a>.
