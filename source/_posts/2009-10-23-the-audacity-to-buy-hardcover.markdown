I just read about David Plouffe's new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670021334">The Audacity to Win</a>, which is coming out on November 3. I'm all set to buy it for Kindle until I check the price difference and discover that the hardcover copy is only $3 more than the Kindle edition. Why the fuck would I buy a DRM'd digital copy when I can get it in paper for less than I spent on coffee this morning?

This is completely stupid. I love that Kindle books tend to cost me 50% or less of the price of the physical edition. But, when they don't, there's zero value in buying the encumbered version. Bite me, Amazon.
