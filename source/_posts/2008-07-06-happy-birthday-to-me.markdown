My birthday happened to land on July 4th this year, just as it has for the 25 prior birthdays I have had. As always, I celebrated at someone else's house party and watched fireworks in the evening. Here are some of the results. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157605992595826/">The rest are up on Flickr</a>.Â
