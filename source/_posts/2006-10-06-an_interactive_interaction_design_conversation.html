<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/aboutus/dan.php">Dan Saffer</a>, a Senior Interaction Designer at Adaptive Path, is the guest of <a href="http://user.well.com/engaged/iengaged.cgi?c=inkwell.vue&f=0&t=283&q=0-">the latest conversation on the Inkwell.vue</a>. Dan recently released a book entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDesigning-Interaction-Creating-Applications-Devices%2Fdp%2F0321432061%2F&tag=sixdollarchim-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Designing for Interaction: Creating Smart Applications and Clever Devices</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sixdollarchim-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but it certainly sounds interesting. I'm going to order a copy, and I'll review it on here the first chance I get.

  The conversation on Inkwell seems refreshingly broad and deep, to the extent that I find myself unable to sum it up in a pithy blockquote. It's well-worth reading, in any case. Actually, I take that back, here's one which ties in well to my entry regarding Dharmesh Shah's blog:
  <blockquote>And I think, from my perspective, this [strategic decisions being made by designers] is happening more and more. You see Design on the cover of BusinessWeek. Businesses are looking at Apple's stock price post-iPod. Companies like Procter & Gamble are serious about including design into their product creation cycles.

  The flip side is, of course, that there are large corporations, government agencies and indeed whole industries and governments (including the US Government) that don't give much of a damn about design at all. And those organizations affect us every single day in profound ways.

  My guess is that smaller-scale products and services will be better designed in the near future, while larger scale will continue to not be. I'm not sure how to change that prediction.</blockquote>
