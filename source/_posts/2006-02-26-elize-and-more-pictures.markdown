Elize got married yesterday in a very-sudden fashion. It was a small ceremony; not more than 15-20 people. I hadn't seen a few of the people there in years, literally. It was great to see Elize's parents again, along with NJ and Melissa.

  I posted pictures on my <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/gallery/v/elizeswedding/">gallery site</a>.

  I also dug through my media center's hard drive today to clear up a bunch of old photos that had accumulated. For these, I've added the following galleries:
  <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/gallery/v/duluth/">Duluth - July 2003</a>
  <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/gallery/v/21stbday/">My 21st Birthday</a>
