I've been swamped lately:
<ul>
	<li>I have one more update to the Slate Poll Tracker '08 that's mostly complete (it just requires some performance testing and enhancement).</li>
	<li>I am in the final stages of delivering an iPhone app to a startup that shall remain nameless until it shows up in my portfolio.</li>
	<li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/2950271979/">I voted yesterday</a>.</li>
	<li>I am working on another iPhone application in my <em>copious</em> amounts of free time (<em>cough</em>).</li>
	<li>I am working on another iPhone application in my <em><strong>copious</strong></em> amounts of free time (<em>double cough</em>).</li>
	<li>I am at the tail-end of a slightly more than ambitious UI-related project for Virtual Lab (note: <strong>real job</strong>).</li>
	<li>I'm doing an executive photo shoot for <a href="http://www.extrahop.com/">ExtraHop</a> next weekend. I decided that my sweet lil Canon 430EX wasn't going to cut it, so I just ordered a Nikon SB-800 to replace it as my main light (see email below).</li>
	<li>It looks like some combination of the latest versions of Mac OS X and iTunes have conspired to cause some issues in iRooster, so I'm working on an update for that, too.</li>
</ul>

<div>btw, i just decided that my sweet lil 430EX speedlite wasn't going to cut it and ordered Joe McNally's old standby, the Nikon SB-800. Jiminy F'in Christmas. :)</div>

<div>I need to go pick up another PW II+, stand, and brass monkey at some point so I can do 2 lights. This is the worst gadget affliction I've ever had.</div></blockquote>
