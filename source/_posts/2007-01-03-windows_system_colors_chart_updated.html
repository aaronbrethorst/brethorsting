A co-worker of mine was nice enough to update my <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/10/windows_system_colors.html">Windows system color chart with the Royale theme from Windows XP Media Center Edition. You can find the updated chart at <a href="http://www.brethorsting.com/uidesign/2006/10/01/syscolors.html">its original location</a>. Thanks, Moneta!
