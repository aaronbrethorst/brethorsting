so, it looks like my new domain is pretty much all working at this point. It took less than 24 hours for it to percolate through the DNS system. I'm impressed. Usually it takes a wee bit longer than that.

As a sidenote, you may notice that I am using movable type in lieu of livejournal here. I decided that LJ was getting rather tiresome given its limited feature set, total lack of sane rss output, etc.

so, umm, yeah. I will end up using this for reasonably meaningful stuff, once I'm done giving the system a sanity check at least.
