It snowed here in Seattle starting in the wee hours of the morning. I woke up from a thunderclap around 5:30AM, and then heard another one a few minutes later. We've only received a couple inches, but <a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/36371689.html">that's still enough to tank the whole city</a>. Check out how well the bus I take to and from my house is doing right now.
