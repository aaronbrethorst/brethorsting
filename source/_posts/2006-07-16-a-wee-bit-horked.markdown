I just upgraded my blog from Movable Type 3.2 to 3.3, and I appear to be running into a few issues. Hopefully, this post will find the isues resolved. Otherwise, I may just give it up and migrate to Wordpress (like I should've done a while ago :-P). Of course, considering the nature of the issues I'm seeing, the fact that you could even read this post means that everything's hunky dory again.
