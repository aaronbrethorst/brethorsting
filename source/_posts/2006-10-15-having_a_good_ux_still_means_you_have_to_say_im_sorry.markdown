I just found this blog entry from <a href="http://www.rebellin.net/archives/000901.html">Rebellin Woman</a>:
  <blockquote>Today marked the end of Day 3 where a hacker has had access to my personal Gmail account, and Google has done absolutely nothing to rectify the problem.

  What really urks me is that yesterday, I looked up Google's VP of Search and User Experience, Sheryl Sandberg. I have left her a voice mail and three emails, and do you think she has managed to respond or forward on my emails?! NO!!!

  Evidently, the woman in charge of the user experience doesn't care that my identity is at risk because my account has been compromised and no one has bothered to help me with the problem that I reported mere minutes after the security breach.

  I don't want this site to be a Google rant. I'd love to tell you how they finally reacted and stopped the hacker in his tracks. In fact, I'd love to tell you about the positive stuff happening in my life right now, like my 2 year wedding anniversary and my daughter turning 8 months this week. But I'm too consumed with this crap to even think about those positive things.

  Yeesh. Over the past three years, there have been many times when I've received urgent mails from execs asking for followup on customer-reported issues. Although they've always been important, I don't think they've necessarily had this level of seriousness associated with them. I hope this works out for the best. You know, one of the nice things about being a veep is that you should be able to tell people to do things like 'help a customer with a serious privacy issue.'

  I'm going to try to make this my last Google post for a while, as I feel like I'm sounding like too much of a partisan. Grain of salt, and all that, no?
