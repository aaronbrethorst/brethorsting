I'm eating lunch and watching <a href="http://www.veracifier.com/episode/TPM_20080604">TPMTV's recap of the McCain trainwreck</a> from last night, and I was struck by how much McCain blinked and stumbled over his words. A cursory glance at the current information on the psychology of lying suggests that liars actually blink <em>less</em> than people who believe they're speaking the truth, but it does indicated a high level of nervousness. Hmm.
