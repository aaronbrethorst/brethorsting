For a while now, <a href="http://www.popfly.com">Popfly</a>'s unofficial mascot has been a rather unassuming rubber duckie who rebels against the man with his rakish magenta hue. From my understanding, he spends his weeekends barhopping with college kids along <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ave">the Ave</a>.

  Anyway, my Product Manager, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/">Dan</a>, just forwarded me <a href="http://www.woostercollective.com/2007/07/florentijn_hofmans_rubber_duckie.html">a blog post about another duckie</a> who's making quite the splash, as it were, in France. Remember that a meter is approximately 3.3 feet. Impressive...
