My friend Rob forwarded me a link to an interesting article this morning, entitled <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.php?ident=29676">How to Get Teens to Pay for Virtual Content</a> from MarketingSherpa (gotta love that name):
  <blockquote>Teens register for free and create customizable online characters called Habbos. For most teens, that’s all they need, but some want more and buy virtual Habbo coins, which they use to buy Habbo “furni” to decorate their virtual rooms in the Habbo Hotel and play online games and interact with friends.</blockquote>

  The site focuses its attention on the 14-16 year old range, and seems to be doing a fantastic job of nailing their demographic. The rub, of course, is that this age range doesn't have the income of people even just a couple years older. I wonder what <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life's</a> target demographic is... If I had to speculate, I'd guess it's predominantly women around the age of 30. Anyone know?
