Helen took me to Salish Lodge as a birthday present to me this year (in addition to some beautiful clothes, and the Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens). Nice girl ;-)

Naturally, we took a few pictures over two days, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157606021488319/">I've uploaded the first round of them to Flickr</a>. There are another few hundred I need to cull through, so expect a supplemental post on this topic soon.
