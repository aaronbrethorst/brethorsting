I was in Boulder, Colorado last weekend for the wedding of two friends of mine from high school, Afton and Abbie. Even though they had a professional wedding photographer at work, I still took a few hundred pictures. All told, I ended up with a handful of good shots. Here are a few of my favorites. As always, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aaronbrethorst/sets/72157605385271757/">more are available on Flickr</a>.
