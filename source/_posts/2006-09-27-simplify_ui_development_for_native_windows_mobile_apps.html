<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmobile/archive/2006/09/11/749467.aspx">Mel Sampat from the Windows Mobile team blogged about a new UI management library</a>, called ScreenLib, that dramatically simplifies creating native user interfaces for Windows Mobile applications:
  <blockquote>[ScreenLib] takes away a lot of the pain of designing user interfaces for multiple screen sizes, orientations, form factors etc. It lets you create a user interface once and have it automatically adapt to whatever the deviceâ€™s screen size is at runtime. By doing this, it offers basic docking & anchoring support for native development and can do a lot of UI plumbing work with just 1 or 2 lines of code.

  ScreenLib works on Pocket PC and Smartphone devices, so it's a great step towards creating single binaries that will run on both platforms.</blockquote>

  If it wasn't for the fact that I'm a managed code-only developer on the Windows platform, I'd be all over this library ;-)
