I finally bit the bullet and moved off Wordpress today after learning that my blog had been hacked at some point in the recent past. I decided to switch over to Octopress, which is based on Jekyll, in part because there's an easy-to-use Wordpress importer. Additionally, I was able to install a clean version of Wordpress, and dump out a collection of all of my posts into WxR format, so no content lost, no permalinks changed.

Yay for Ruby, boo for Wordpress security.
