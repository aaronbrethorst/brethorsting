I was cleaning up some backend code of mine last week and ended up introducing a bug into the Chimp Tunes code that:
  1. Updates song titles in the database.
  2. Downloads cover art for display in your Snooze window.

  I finally figured out what was causing this (dumb mistake on my part), and that's all working again. Hooray.

  More info forthcoming on iRooster. I really am working on it still. I promise.
