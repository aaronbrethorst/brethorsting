I just found <a href="http://www.core77.com/bullitts/2006/08/Synaptics-and-Pilotfish-Onyx-phone.asp?current_bullitt_id=486">a bolus of information</a> on a concept phone produced by <a href="http://www.synaptics.com/">Synaptics</a>, makers of touchpads everywhere and Pilotfish, a German/Taiwanese design firm. The concept incorporates some unique elements to enhance usability, such as automatically answering a call when the phone is held to the user's cheek.
  <blockquote>While Onyx features convenient and intuitive new commands such as drag-and-drop, more sophisticated elements come to play, where you can close tasks by swiping an "x" over them and the touchpad can recognize whether finger input is coming from one finger, two fingers, or a finger on its side.</blockquote>
