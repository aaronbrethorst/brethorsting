I've been reading coverage of PocketWizard's <a href="http://www.pocketwizard.com/products/transmitter_receiver/flextt5%20canon/">just-announced</a> FlexTT5 and MiniTT1 RF transmitter units, and I just have to say: "wowza!" 

David Hobby has <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/2009/02/pocketwizard-flextt5-and-minitt1-full.html">a fantastic write-up available over on Strobist</a>, which gives as much information on these as you could possibly want, and I have to say I'm really excited. Faster sync speeds (1/500s or 1/8000s in FP mode), firmware updates, smaller profile, hot shoes, hooray!

Plus, they're backwards compatible with the existing II+s, which means I don't have to scrap my existing investment, making me a very happy camper. I was planning on picking up another PW unit sometime in the near future, and now I guess I'm just going to have to wait until March 1st to put my order in.
