For some reason, i feel like i am emailing santa claus. I'm saddened to hear that you've resigned. 

You've been an inspiration to me for well over half my life. I wish you all the best, and if I prayed, you'd be in them. 

You're an inspiration to millions, and an incredible human being. 

I hope to see a fourth act. Godspeed.
